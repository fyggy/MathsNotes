# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
## First Order ODEs
Q: What is an ODE? 
A: A relation between a function of one variable, e.g. ${} y(x) {}$, and one or more of it's derivatives.

A *partial* differential equation is a differential equation in more than one variable, i.e. ${} y(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}) {}$, and we use the *partial* derivatives, such as
$$
\frac{ \partial y }{ \partial x_{1} } 
$$
These will not be covered in this module.
### Notation:
We write a function ${} x(t)$, where $t$ is usually time. We also write ${} y(x)$ for a more abstract notation. We will write ${} \dot{x} {}$ to denote differentiation in respect to *time* specifically, and $y' {}$ to denote differentiation with respect to it's base variable.

#### Examples:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}  = 3x^{2} \sin(x+t)
$$
The *order* of an ODE is equal to the highest derivative, so the above is order 1, or first order. 
$$
\ddot{x}=\cos(2t)
$$
This is order 2
$${} y'''-4y'+x=0 {}$$
This is order 3.

In this course we will study first order ODEs. In general, these are of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x, t)
$$
A solution to the ODE is a function of $t$ that satisfies the above equation. For example, if ${} g(t)$ is a solution of the above, then 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} g(t)=f(g(t), t)
$$
holds for all $t {}$.

The most simple example is an equation of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =0
$$
We have ${} g(t)=0 {}$ as a solution, and so is ${} g(t)=1 {}$. In general, we have ${} g(t)=c {}$ for all ${} c \in \mathbb{F} {}$. For a first order ODE, we will always have a maximum of *one* constant in the general solution.
### General Solution
The general solution is the family of functions ${} h(t, c) {}$ such that 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} h(t, c)=f(h(t, c),t)
$$
and this should hold for all ${} c \in \mathbb{F} {}$.
#### Example:
$${} \dot{x}=2 {}$$
One solution is ${} g(t)=2t+1 {}$. We see that
$$
\frac{d}{dt} g(t)=2=2\qquad\text{ which is true}
$$
the general solution, however, is
$$
h(t,\, c)=2t+c
$$
and we see that again, 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} h(t, c)=2=2\qquad \text{ which is true for all } c \in \mathbb{F}
$$
#### Example:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =x^{2}+2t
$$
What is ${} f(x, t) {}$? In particular, we have ${} f(x,\, t)=x^{2}+2t {}$. Now if ${} h(t,\, c) {}$ is a solution, suppose we have ${} h(t,\, c)=t+c {}$. We see that 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} h(t,\, c)=1
$$
but
$$
\begin{align}
 f(h(t,\, c),\, t) & =(t+c)^{2}+2t  \\
  & =t^{2}+2tc+c^{2}+2t
 \end{align}
$$
so it is *not* a solution
### Initial Value Problem
(IVP). In the first order, we have only a single initial condition. Consider
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x,\, t)
$$
and ${} x(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$. Usually, this has one solution, but it can have none, a finite number $\geq 1$, or an infinite number of solution.

A solution to an IVP:
${} g(t)$ is a solution iff 
$$
\frac{d}{dt} g(t)=f(g(t),\, t) \text{ and } g(t_{0})=x_{0}
$$
There are *no* general solutions for IVP.
