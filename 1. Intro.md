# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
## First Order ODEs
Q: What is an ODE? 
A: A relation between a function of one variable, e.g. ${} y(x) {}$, and one or more of it's derivatives.

A *partial* differential equation is a differential equation in more than one variable, i.e. ${} y(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}) {}$, and we use the *partial* derivatives, such as
$$
\frac{ \partial y }{ \partial x_{1} } 
$$
These will not be covered in this module.
### Notation:
We write a function ${} x(t)$, where $t$ is usually time. We also write ${} y(x)$ for a more abstract notation. We will write ${} \dot{x} {}$ to denote differentiation in respect to *time* specifically, and $y' {}$ to denote differentiation with respect to it's base variable.

#### Examples:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt}  = 3x^{2} \sin(x+t)
$$
The *order* of an ODE is equal to the highest derivative, so the above is order 1, or first order. 
$$
\ddot{x}=\cos(2t)
$$
This is order 2
$${} y'''-4y'+x=0 {}$$
This is order 3.

In this course we will study first order ODEs. In general, these are of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x, t)
$$
A solution to the ODE is a function of $t$ that satisfies the above equation.
