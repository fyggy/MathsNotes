If you are having diﬃculty with any of the questions or want feedback on speciﬁc answers you should ask your tutor in your next tutorial or attend the lecturer’s oﬃce hours. 1. (a) Evaluate the following sums. (i) 9∑ k=5 4(k − 5) (ii) 3∑ j=0 5∑ k=0(j − k) (iii) n∑ k=1 n∑ j=1 2j (b) Fill in the blanks so that the following sums are all equal. 12∑ j=−1 √ 2j + 7 = 18∑ j= √ 2j + = ∑ j= √ 2j + 3 (c) Show that 1 2 n∑ k=0 n∑ j=0 (j + k)2 = (n + 1) n∑ k=0 k2 + ( n∑ k=0 k )2 . 2. (a) Express each of the following numbers in the form a + ib for some a, b ∈ R, then compute its modulus. Do not use decimal approximations (so 0.2 or 1/5 are both okay, but while 1/3 is ﬁne, 0.33 is not). (i) (−3 + 4i) + (6 + 7i) (ii) (2 + 5i)(3 − 2i) (iii) 1 3i − 2 (iv) (i + √5) 2 (v) (1 + i)(1 + 2i)(1 + 3i) (vi) ( 1 + i 1 − i )2 (b) Let z = (1 + i)/ √2. Determine the following in the form a + ib. (Do you spot a pattern that would allow you to solve the last part? ) (i) z2 (ii) z3 (iii) z4 (iv) z6 (v) z8 (vi) z100 1 3. Decide whether each of the following statements are true or false. In each case either explain why it is true or give a counterexample to show that it is false. (a) If z + w is real then z and w must be real. (b) If zw is real then z and w must be real. (c) If z is real then z must be real. (d) If z − z is real then z must be real. 4. Determine the solutions z ∈ C of each of the following equations and sketch each set of solutions on the complex plane. (a) |z + 1| = 2 (b) z = z + 2i (c) z2 = (z) 2 5. Let z, w ∈ C with w ̸= 0. Prove the following statements. (a) ( z w ) = z w (b) \f \f \f z w \f \f \f = |z| |w| 2","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
