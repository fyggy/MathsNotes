The additional practice problems are not required: try them if you’re interested and have time. The problems marked with (SS) will be discussed in the Skills Session for Week 1. Please attempt these before your Skills Session. Some of the other problems will be discussed in your tutorial for Week 2. Please attempt these problems before your tutorial. Core problems Exercise 1. Consider the following subsets of Z: A = {3n | n ∈ Z}, B = { a ∈ Z | − 6 < a ≤ 6 }, C = { −3, 2, 4, 9, 31 }. List all elements of the following sets: (i) B ∪ (A ∩ C) (ii) (B ∪ A) ∩ C (iii) (B \\ A) ∩ C Exercise 2 (SS). Let A, B, and C be as deﬁned in Exercise 1. List the elements of the set (A ∩ B) × (A ∩ C) Exercise 3. Let A, B and C be subsets of a set X. Prove that (A ∪ B) ∩ C = (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C). Exercise 4 (SS). Let X and Y be sets. Let A1 and A2 be subsets of X. Prove that (A1 × Y ) ∩ (A2 × Y ) = (A1 ∩ A2) × Y Exercise 5 (SS). Let f : N × Z → Z be deﬁned by f ((x, y)) = x + y. Show that f is surjective. Exercise 6. Let g : R → R be deﬁned by g(x) = { 0 if x ≤ 0 1 if x > 0 Show that the function f : R → R × R deﬁned by f (x) = (x2, g(x)) is injective. Exercise 7. Let A, B, C be sets. Suppose f : A → B and g : B → C are surjective functions. Show that g ◦ f is surjective. Exercise 8. Prove by induction that the sum of the ﬁrst n odd positive squares is 1 3 (4n3 − n), i.e. that 1 + 9 + 25 + · · · + (2n − 1) 2 = 1 3 (4n3 − n). Additional practice Exercise 9. Find a function f : Z → Z such that (i) f is injective but not surjective. (ii) f is surjective but not injective. Exercise 10. Let X and Y be sets. Let A1, A2 ⊂ X and B1, B2 ⊂ Y . For the following statements about subsets of X × Y , give either a proof or a counterexample. (i) (A1 × B1) ∩ (A2 × B2) = (A1 ∩ A2) × (B1 ∩ B2). (ii) (A1 × B1) ∪ (A2 × B2) = (A1 ∪ A2) × (B1 ∪ B2). Exercise 11. Let X be a ﬁnite set with n elements. (i) How many subsets does X have? (ii) How many functions X → {0, 1} exist? (iii) Think about how and why your answer to (i) relates to your answer to (ii). Exercise 12. Let A be a set with n elements and let B be a set with m elements. Find a formula for the number of injective functions f : A → B. 2","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
