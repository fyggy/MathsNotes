Negations will be written by ‘striking out’: /∈ is to be read “is not an element of”. See section 1 below for the use of these symbols. 0.2 Numbers We use the symbols N, Z, Q, R and C to denote the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers respectively. For a real number x, we denote by ⌊x⌋ the greatest integer which is less than or equal to x, and by ⌈x⌉ the smallest integer which is greater than or equal to x. For example, ⌈5.25⌉ = 6, ⌊5.25⌋ = 5, ⌈8⌉ = 8, ⌊8⌋ = 8, ⌈−7.3⌉ = −7, ⌊−7.3⌋ = −8, ⌈π⌉ = 4. 0.3 Logical Symbols ∀ for all ∃ there exists =⇒ implies, is a suﬃcient condition for ⇐⇒ if and only if, iﬀ See Section 3 below for the use of these symbols. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 4 1 Set Theory Mathematicians are like Frenchmen: whatever you say to them they translate into their own language and forthwith it is something entirely diﬀerent. J. W. Goethe This preliminary chapter sets up some notation and makes sure we have a common language in which to talk mathematically. Every object that we encounter in mathematics belongs to a set. It is important therefore to know the language of sets and to know how sets can be manipulated. 1.1 Sets We shall take a set to be ‘a collection of objects’. The objects will be referred to as elements. We specify a set in one of two ways. 1. By listing its elements. For instance S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, or A = {−2, 0, 3, π}, or X = {Alice, Bob, Carol}. 2. By stating a property that determines membership, e.g. Z+ = {x integer : x ≥ 0} or Z+ = {x integer | x ≥ 0}. (1.1) This is to be read as “Z+ is the set of all integers x such that x is greater than or equal to 0”. The colon “:” or the sign “|” here simply separate diﬀerent parts of the deﬁnition from each other. We use the symbols N, Z, Q, R and C to denote the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers respectively: N = {1, 2, 3, . . . } Z = {0, ±1, ±2, . . . } Q = {a/b : a ∈ Z, b ∈ N} We will look at R more carefully soon. We can think of it intuitively as the set of all points on a straight line extending indeﬁnitely in both directions. In some books you will see N deﬁned to include 0 too. It does not matter how you deﬁne it, provided that once you do deﬁne it you stick to your deﬁnition. If x is an element of S we write x ∈ S. If it is not we write x /∈ S. x ∈ S may be written as S ∋ x. With this notation, we can rewrite the deﬁnition (1.1) in a more standard way as Z+ = {x ∈ Z : x ≥ 0}. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 5 Consider the following example. Let U be the set deﬁned by U = {(−1) n : n ∈ N}. The set U coincides with {−1, 1}, despite the fact that in the above deﬁnition, each of the numbers 1, −1 is listed inﬁnitely many times. We say that S is a subset of T and write S ⊂ T if every element of S is an element of T . S ⊂ T can equally well be written as T ⊃ S. The empty set, denoted ∅, is the set containing no elements. By convention, it is a subset of every set. Example. Let us list all possible subsets of the set {1, 2, 3}. These are: ∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}. Notice that N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R. To say that the sets A and B are equal is to say that they have the same elements. In other words, to say that A = B is to say both that if x ∈ A then also x ∈ B and if y ∈ B then also y ∈ A. We can write this as A = B is the same as { x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B y ∈ B ⇒ y ∈ A. Alternatively, using the notation ⊂, this can be written as A = B if and only if (A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A). 1.2 Finite and inﬁnite sets The diﬀerence between ﬁnite and inﬁnite sets should be intuitively clear. For example, the sets {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {−2, 0, 3, π}, {Alice, Bob, Carol}, are all ﬁnite, whereas the sets N, Z, Q, R are all inﬁnite. For any ﬁnite set X we can determine the number of elements of X, simply by counting its elements. The number of elements of a set X is called the cardinality of X and is denoted by #X. For example, #{−2, 0, 3, π} = 4. It should be clear that if A ⊂ B, then (#A) ≤ (#B). One can often see diﬀerent notation for cardinality of A, e.g. |A| or card A. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 6 Later on you will meet a more rigorous mathematical approach to the deﬁnition of ﬁniteness and cardinality of sets. For now, it is suﬃcient to remember that one has to take extra care with inﬁnite sets; they can behave in a way that at a ﬁrst glance may seem counterintuitive. For example: if you take away an element of a ﬁnite set A, its cardinality decreases by one. If you take away an element of an inﬁnite set, its cardinality remains the same; in a rigorous sense, the two sets N = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . . } and {2, 3, 4, . . . } have the same cardinality. 1.3 Operations with sets We can form new sets from the given ones using the operations union, intersection and complement. The union of two sets A and B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set of all elements which are either in A or in B (or both). Their intersection, A ∩ B, is the set of those elements that are both in A and in B. Notation A\\B stands for the complement of B in A, i.e. the set of all elements of A which are not in B. Example Within the natural numbers N suppose A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {1, 2, 5}. Then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} , A ∩ B = {1, 2} , A\\B = {3, 4}. It is clear that for any sets A, B, one has A ⊂ A ∪ B and B ⊂ A ∪ B and also A ∩ B ⊂ A and A ∩ B ⊂ B. 1.4 Intervals The following subsets of R are called intervals. (i) [a, b] = {x ∈ R : a ≤ x ≤ b}. (ii) (a, b) = {x ∈ R : a < x < b}. (iii) (a, b] = {x ∈ R : a < x ≤ b}. (iv) (−∞, b] = {x ∈ R : x ≤ b}. (v) (a, ∞) = {x ∈ R : a < x}. (vi) (−∞, ∞) = R. Note that the symbol ∞ is only used as part of the notation. It is not a real number! ∞ is not a real number! There is no such real number as ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 7 (i), (iv) and (vi) are closed intervals. (ii), (v) and (vi) are open intervals. We shall not deﬁne precisely what it means to be ‘open’ or ‘closed’ here although you probably have an intuitive feel for these concepts. Example. Which of the following statements are true? (a) 3 ∈ (1, 2), (b) 2 ∈ (−∞, 3], (c) 1 ∈ [1, 2], (d) 2 ∈ (0, 2), (e) [0, 1] ⊂ (0, 2). We shall often apply the operations of union and intersection to intervals. Example. One has: (−∞, 1) ∩ [−1, ∞) = [−1, 1); (−∞, 1) ∪ [−1, ∞) = R; (−1, 0] ∪ [0, 1] = (−1, 1]; (−1, 0] ∩ [0, 1] = {0}. 1.5 Multiple and inﬁnite unions and intersections The notions of union and intersection extend to the situation with more than just two sets. For example, A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 = {x | x ∈ A1 or x ∈ A2 or x ∈ A3} = {x | x belongs to at least one of the sets A1, A2, A3} = {x | x ∈ Ai for at least one of the indices i = 1, 2, 3}. More generally, for n sets A1, A2, . . . , An we have A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An = {x | x ∈ Ai for at least one of the indices i = 1, 2, . . . , n}. (1.2) There is a more convenient piece of notation for such a union: n⋃ i=1 Ai = A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An. This notation works similarly to the ∑ -notation for a sum of several terms. The index i here is a “dummy variable”, i.e. it can be replaced by any other letter, e.g. n⋃ i=1 Ai = n⋃ j=1 Aj = n⋃ ℓ=1 Aℓ. Example. Let Ai = [0, i] for i = 1, . . . , 10. Then 10⋃ i=1 Ai = [0, 10]. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 8 Let us rewrite our deﬁnition (1.2) as n⋃ i=1 Ai = {x | x ∈ Ai for some i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}}. Let Λ denote the “index set” {1, 2, . . . , n}. This is just the set of labels for the collection of sets we are considering. Then the above can be conveniently written as ⋃ i∈Λ Ai = {x | x ∈ Ai for some i ∈ Λ}. This all makes sense for any non-empty index set Λ. In particular, Λ may be inﬁnite. If Λ = N, one often writes ∞⋃ i=1 Ai for ⋃ λ∈Λ Aλ. Example. Let Λ = N and Aj = [j, j + 1] for j ∈ N. Then ∞⋃ j=1 Aj = [1, ∞). A similar discussion can be made regarding intersections: n⋂ i=1 Ai = A1 ∩ A2 ∩ · · · ∩ An = {x | x ∈ Ai for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}} and more generally ⋂ i∈Λ Ai = {x | x ∈ Ai for all i ∈ Λ}. Example. 1. Consider the following inﬁnite collection of open intervals: (−1, 1), (−2, 2), (−3, 3), (−4, 4), . . . We can form the union and intersection of these intervals: ∞⋃ n=1 (−n, n) = R, ∞⋂ n=1 (−n, n) = (−1, 1). 2. Consider the following inﬁnite sequence of sets, each of which consists precisely of one point: {1}, {2}, {3}, . . . Then the union and intersection of these sets are: ∞⋃ n=1 {n} = N; ∞⋂ n=1 {n} = ∅. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 9 3. Consider the following inﬁnite collection of open intervals: (−1, 1), (−1/2, 1/2), (−1/3, 1/3), (−1/4, 1/4), . . . We can form the union and intersection of these intervals: ∞⋃ n=1 (−1/n, 1/n) = (−1, 1), ∞⋂ n=1 (−1/n, 1/n) = {0}. 4. Consider the intervals (a − 1, a + 1) where a ∈ [0, 1]. We have ⋃ a∈[0,1][a − 1, a + 1] = [−1, 2], ⋂ a∈[0,1] [a − 1, a + 1] = [0, 1]. We will discuss the above examples in more detail soon. You should do some exercises to get used to these concepts. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 10 2 Functions This section will be considered only brieﬂy in lectures, with the foundational material for functions being considered more carefully in 4CCM111a (Calculus I). 2.1 Basics The concept of function is very important in every branch of mathematics. Here is the formal deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 2.1. Let A and B be sets. Then a function f : A → B is a rule which assigns exactly one element of B to each element of A. The set A is called the domain of the function, the set B is called the codomain or the target set. If x is an element of A then the element of B assigned to x by the function f is usually denoted f (x). In this context, x ∈ A is usually called the argument of the function f and f (x) ∈ B is called its value. Depending on the situation, various synonyms to the term “function” are often used: map, mapping, morphism. In order to set up a function, you have to specify three objects: (i) the set A; (ii) the set B; (iii) the rule f . Some functions have standard names, others have names (usually a single letter) deﬁned for a particular piece of work. You should be familiar with the following standard functions from R to R: sin, cos, exp. Here are some other standard functions: log : (0, ∞) → R, x 7→ log(x); tan : R \\ { π 2 + πn | n ∈ Z} → R, x 7→ tan(x); the ceiling function ⌈·⌉ : R → Z, x 7→ ⌈x⌉; the square root √· : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞), x 7→ √x; the square : R → R, x 7→ x2; a linear function : R → R, x 7→ 2x + 3. Of course, in the last example, 2 and 3 can be replaced by any real numbers. In setting up a function, there is sometimes a certain freedom in choosing the sets A and B. For example, the square root can be deﬁned either as a function from [0, ∞) to [0, ∞) or as a function from [0, ∞) to R. We will discuss this later. For now, remember that you have to be very clear about your choices of the sets A, B; you can make any suitable choice, but you have to stick to this choice throughout your piece of work. For functions from R to R, plotting their graph is a very useful tool in analysing them. In this course we will mostly discuss functions f : R → R, but in general, the domain and the target sets can be fairly arbitrary: 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 11 Example. Let A be the set of students in this class, let B = {1, 2, . . . , 100} and for a student x ∈ A let f (x) be the age of x in years. This sets up a function f : A → B. Example. Let P be the set of all polygons on the plane. We can deﬁne two functions, f and g, on the set P . For p ∈ P , let f (p) be the number of edges of p and let g(p) be the area of p. Thus, we have deﬁned two functions f : P → N and g : P → R. 2.2 Setting up a function A function can be set up, or deﬁned, in various ways. The most common way to deﬁne a function of real numbers is to write down an analytic expression for it. For example, f (x) = 2x + 3, g(x) = √x − 3, and h(x) = log(2x + 4) deﬁne functions of a real variable x. In such simple cases, there is usually no need to specify the domain of a function explicitly: the domain is assumed to include all values of x for which the corresponding analytic expression makes sense, i.e. can be computed. For example, one immediately sees that the domain of f is R, the domain of g is [3, ∞) and the domain of h is (−2, ∞). In more complex cases, a function can be deﬁned by a diﬀerent analytic expression for diﬀerent values of its argument. For example, the sign function is deﬁned as sign(x) =  | | 1 if x > 0, 0 if x = 0, −1 if x < 0. The modulus, or absolute value function is deﬁned as |x| = { x if x ≥ 0, −x if x < 0. One can deﬁne more complex functions for a particular piece of work; for example, f (x) =  | | 0 if x ≤ −1, √1 − x2 if −1 < x < 0, 1 if 0 ≤ x. In mathematics, one often has to consider very complex and “weird” functions. A classic example is Thomae’s function: f (x) = { 1/n if x is rational, x = m/n, n ∈ N, m and n have no common factors; 0 if x is irrational. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 12 One cannot even attempt to construct a graph of this function! However, this is a perfectly well deﬁned function which can be mathematically analysed. In particular, f turns out to be continuous at all irrational points and discontinuous at all rational points. Another example is the Weierstrass’ function: g(x) = ∞∑ n=0 an cos(bnπx), x ∈ R, (2.1) where 0 < a < 1, b > 1, ab ≥ 1 are real parameters. This deﬁnition uses the notion of series, which we will only brieﬂy mention at the end of this course. Weierstrass proved (with a later improvement by G. H. Hardy) that this function is continuous but nowhere diﬀerentiable. 2.3 Injective and surjective functions There is some further terminology for functions which is useful. Deﬁnition 2.2. A function f is said to be injective or one-to-one if f (x) = f (y) ⇒ x = y . In words, a function is injective if distinct elements of the domain are always mapped to distinct elements of the codomain. (If two diﬀerent elements of the domain are mapped to the same element of the codomain, then the function is not injective.) Example. Consider the following functions: sin : R → R , x 7→ sin x exp : R → R , x 7→ exp x = ex log : (0, ∞) → R , x 7→ log x f : R → R , x 7→ x2 g : (3, ∞) → R , x 7→ 1 x−3 h : R → R , x 7→ x3 − x Which functions in the above examples are injective? Deﬁnition 2.3. Let f : A → B be a function. Then f (A), the image (or range) of A under the function f , is the set {y ∈ B | y = f (x) for some x ∈ A} ⊂ B . Example. What are the images of the functions in the above examples? It is sometimes the case that the image of a function is equal to the entire codomain. In this case the function is said to be surjective. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 13 Deﬁnition 2.4. A function f : A → B is said to be surjective (or onto) if f (A) = B . Example. Which functions in the above examples are surjective? It is of course possible for a function to be both injective and surjective. This situation is suﬃciently important to have a name of its own. Deﬁnition 2.5. A function which is both injective and surjective is said to be bijective. Example. Which functions in the above examples are bijective? In principle, you can always change the deﬁnition of your function to make it surjective. For example, if you consider sin not as a function from R to R, but as a function from R to [−1, 1], then it becomes surjective. This is not always convenient though, because often the range of your function is unknown (or is complicated). 2.4 Composition and inverse Deﬁnition 2.6. Let A, B, C, be sets and f : A → B and g : B → C be functions. Then the composition g ◦ f is a function deﬁned by (g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)), x ∈ A. Warning 1: in order to deﬁne the composition g ◦ f , one has to make sure that the image of f is a subset of the domain of g. For example, consider f : R → R, f (x) = sin x, g : [0, ∞) → R, g(x) = log x. Then g ◦ f is NOT deﬁned. Indeed, g(f (x)) = log(sin x), and if sin x < 0, this expression makes no sense! Warning 2: in general g ◦ f ̸= f ◦ g, even if both expressions are well deﬁned. For example, if f : R → R is f (x) = x + 1 and g : R → R is g(x) = x2, then f ◦ g(x) = x2 + 1 and g ◦ f (x) = (x + 1)2 = x2 + 2x + 1. An important feature of a bijective function is that it has a (unique) inverse. Deﬁnition 2.7. Let f : A → B be a bijective function. Then a function g : B → A is the inverse of the function f if and only if it satisﬁes (g ◦ f )(x) = x, ∀x ∈ A and (f ◦ g)(y) = y, ∀y ∈ B. The function g with these properties is denoted f −1. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 14 Every bijective function has an inverse. On the other hand, if a function is not bijective then it does not have an inverse. At a practical level, in order to ﬁnd the inverse of a function f , you need to solve the equation f (x) = y for x. Example. Find the inverse of f : R → R, f (x) = 2x + 1. Find the inverse of exp : R → (0, ∞). 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 15 3 Logic We shall do a fair amount of theorem proving in this course, so it is important to be competent at logic. 3.1 Propositions For our purposes it will be suﬃcient to deﬁne a proposition to be ‘a statement which is either true or false’. The word statement is often used as a synonym to proposition. Examples A: 5 is a positive integer. B: 3 > 5. C: For all real numbers x, we have x2 ≥ 0. D: There exists a real number a such that a2 = 2. E: The number x is positive. F: The absolute value of x is less than 1. A proposition can contain a variable, such as in the examples E, F above. Here x is a variable, and the proposition can be true or false depending on the value of x. For example, E it is true for x = 1 and false for x = −2. If A and B are propositions, one can form new propositions as follows: ‹ A AND B – is true if and only if both A and B are true; ‹ A OR B – is true if and only if either (A is true) or (B is true) or (both A and B are true); ‹ NOT A – is true if and only if A is false. For example, for propositions E, F above we have: ‹ E AND F means x ∈ (0, 1); ‹ E OR F means x ∈ (−1, ∞); ‹ NOT E means x ≤ 0. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 16 3.2 Quantiﬁers From propositions with variables one can form new propositions by using the quantiﬁers ∃ ‘there exists’ and ∀ ‘for all’. (i) The quantiﬁer ∀ “for all”. For example, from the proposition “b2 ≥ 1 2” (which contains a variable b) we can form a new proposition “∀b ∈ N, one has b2 ≥ 1 2” (which is true). Examples of other propositions formed in this way: 1. All students in this room are called Jane (false) 2. ∀b ∈ R, one has b2 ≥ 1 2 (false) 3. ∀y ∈ R, one has y2 + 3 > 0 (true) 4. ∀t ∈ Z, one has 2t ∈ Z (true) Obviously, the notation for a variable in propositions of such type does not matter. For example, “∀k ∈ R, one has k2 + 3 > 0” is the same proposition as in example 3 above. Notation such as ∀x, y ∈ R is a shorthand for ∀x ∈ R, ∀y ∈ R; for example: ∀x, y ∈ R one has x2 + y2 ≥ 0. (ii) The quantiﬁer ∃ “there exists”. Examples: 1. There is a student in this room whose name is Jane (?) 2. ∃x ∈ R such that |x| < 3 (true) 3. ∃n ∈ N such that n < 0 (false) 4. ∃n ∈ Z such that n < 0 (true) Remark: Instead of writing ∀x ∈ (0, ∞), one often writes ∀x > 0. It is implied that all real positive x are considered. In the same way, one often writes ∃x > 0 instead of ∃x ∈ (0, ∞). Of course, the same convention is applied to other intervals of the real line; e.g., one writes ∀x ≤ 5 instead of ∀x ∈ (−∞, 5]. Unfortunately, these conventions can lead to some ambiguity: for example, if it is understood that a is an integer variable, then ∀a > 0 means ∀a ∈ N, and if a is understood to be a real number, then ∀a > 0 means ∀a ∈ (0, ∞). Usually, the precise meaning is clear from the context and one should take extra care in these situations in mathematical writing to specify precisely the range of your variable. Remember: If a proposition contains a variable, then without a quantiﬁer one cannot establish whether it is true or false! For example, the proposition “N is divisible by 3” makes little sense on its own, since we don’t know anything about N . On the other hand, the propositions “there exists an even integer N which is divisible by 3” (true) or “any even integer N is divisible by 3” (false) are precise mathematical statements, i.e. one can check whether they are true or false. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 17 3.3 Negating propositions It will be VERY IMPORTANT for us to be able to negate propositions, especially those containing variables and symbols ∃ and ∀. Negating simple propositions is straightforward, e.g. negation of x > 0 is x ≤ 0; negation of b = 2 is b ̸= 2. Clearly, if a proposition is true, then its negation is false, and vice versa. When negating propositions containing operations AND, OR, one should replace AND by OR and vice versa: 1. Let A = (the lectures are on Tuesdays AND Thursdays). Then (NOT A) = (there are no lectures on Tuesdays OR there are no lectures on Thursdays) 2. Let B = (You need to bring your passport OR driving licence). Then (NOT B) = (You don’t need to bring your passport AND you don’t need to bring your driving licence). When negating propositions containing symbols ∃ and ∀, one must replace ∃ by ∀ and vice versa: 1. “There exists a left-handed student in this room”. Negation: “All students in this room are right-handed”. 2. “∀x ∈ R, one has x > 0”. Negation: “∃x ∈ R such that x ≤ 0” 3. “∃a ∈ R such that a2 = 2”. Negation: “∀a ∈ R, one has a2 ̸= 2”. 4. “In every country, there is a big city”. Negation: “There is a country that has no big cities”. 5. “∀k ∈ N, ∃j ∈ N such that k < j”. Negation: “∃k ∈ N such that ∀j ∈ N one has k ≥ j”. 6. “∃M ∈ R such that ∀k ∈ N one has k2 ≤ M ”. Negation: “∀M ∈ R, ∃k ∈ N such that k2 > M ”. 3.4 Implication Let A and B be two propositions which contain the same variable. A ⇒ B means ‘if A is true then B is true’. In implications, you need to specify the range of the variable, so such statements will usually include the quantiﬁer ∀. Examples: 1. ∀a ∈ R, one has: a ≥ 1 ⇒ a2 ≥ 1; 2. ∀x ∈ R: x is a solution of x2 = 1 ⇒ x is a solution of x(x2 − 1) = 0; 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 18 3. ∀a, b ∈ R, one has: a ∈ (0, 1) and b ∈ (0, 1) ⇒ (a + b)/2 ∈ (0, 1). A ⇒ B can be equivalently rephrased in one of the following ways: 1. A implies B. 2. If A then B. 3. A is a suﬃcient condition for B. 4. B is a necessary condition for A. Note that it is very often the case that A ⇒ B but NOT B ⇒ A. Examples: 1. k ∈ N ⇒ k ∈ Z but k ∈ Z ̸⇒ k ∈ N; 2. ∀a ∈ R, one has a ≥ 1 ⇒ a2 ≥ 1, but a2 ≥ 1 ̸⇒ a ≥ 1. It is a very common mistake to (explicitly or implicitly) confuse the statements A ⇒ B and B ⇒ A 3.5 The usage of “⇒” If A and B are propositions, then the expression A implies B (in symbols “A ⇒ B”) in a mathematical text can mean at least two diﬀerent things: (a) strict logical meaning: “A implies B” is in itself a proposition, which may be true or false. One may refer to this proposition in the mathematical text. For example: “it is not known whether the irrationality of x tan ey implies the irrationality of y tan e x”. In symbols: “it is not known whether x tan e y ∈ R \\ Q ⇒ y tan e x ∈ R \\ Q is true”. (b) much more often, the expression “A implies B” is used in mathematical arguments to indicate that this implication IS TRUE. For example, “we have proven that x ∈ N; this implies that x > 0.” However, the symbol ⇒ should be used in this sense very sparingly. It is considered a very bad style to use ⇒ in a piece of continuous prose. For example, don’t write something like “x ∈ A and A ⊂ B ⇒ x ∈ B”. Instead write “x ∈ A and A ⊂ B, therefore x ∈ B”. 3.6 Equivalence Let A and B be two propositions which contain the same variable. Then A ⇔ B means that B is true if and only if A is true. In equivalences, you need to specify the range of the variable, so such statements will usually include the quantiﬁer ∀. Examples: 1. ∀x ∈ R: x > 0 ⇔ x + 1 > 1 2. ∀n ∈ Z: n > 1 2 ⇔ n ≥ 1 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 19 3. ∀k ∈ N: k > 2 ⇔ k2 > 4 4. ∀m ∈ Z: m is even ⇔ m 2 is even. A ⇔ B can be rephrased as ‘A is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for B’. 3.7 Converse and contrapositive Let A and B be propositions depending on a variable. For a statement A ⇒ B, the contrapositive is the statement (not B) ⇒ (not A). A contrapositive is true if and only if the original statement is true. For example, the statement “∀a ∈ R, one has a ≥ 1 ⇒ a2 ≥ 1” can be equivalently rewritten as “∀a ∈ R, if a2 < 1 then a < 1” For a statement A ⇒ B, the converse is the statement B ⇒ A. A converse may or may not be true regardless of whether the original statement is true or not. Example: “If you live in London, then you live in England” (true) Converse: “If you live in England, then you live in London” (false). Contrapositive: “If you don’t live in England, then you don’t live in London” (true) 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 20 4 Proofs Reductio ad absurdum, which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician’s ﬁnest weapons. It is a far ﬁner gambit than any chess play: a chess player may oﬀer the sacriﬁce of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician oﬀers the game. G. H. Hardy 4.1 What is a proof ? A proof is a convincing demonstration (within the accepted standards of the ﬁeld) that some mathematical statement is necessarily true. Proofs are obtained from deductive reasoning. In the deductive method one begins with a collection of statements (axioms) that are assumed to be true and then uses logical reasoning (rules of inference) to prove other statements (theorems). Once a theorem is proven, it can be used as the basis to prove further statements. A theorem may also be referred to as a lemma, especially if it is intended for use as a stepping stone in the proof of another theorem. An unproven proposition that is believed to be true is known as a conjecture. By contrast, an inductive method, often used in natural sciences, is a type of reasoning which involves moving from a set of speciﬁc facts to a general conclusion. Inductive method is used in mathematics as a tool for informal discussion, but NOT for proofs. That is, a proof must demonstrate that a statement is true in all cases, without a single exception. Proofs often follow the pattern A1 ⇒ A2 ⇒ A3 ⇒ · · · ⇒ An, where A1 is a statement which is known to be true, An is the statement which needs to be proven and each of the steps Ai ⇒ Ai+1 is suﬃciently clear and based on the rules of logical inference. Proofs employ logic but usually include some amount of natural language which often admits some ambiguity. Ideally, mathematical proofs should be written in a style suﬃciently clear so that they are accepted without dispute by anyone competent in the ﬁeld. Since mathematicians are human, various minor individual deviations from this rule occur in practice. 4.2 The necessity of proofs in mathematics Proof is a cornerstone of mathematics. It is imperative to establish a result by a general argument which applies in all possible cases. It is not enough to try out some particular 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 21 cases, ﬁnd that the result holds in each case tried, and conclude that the result will al- ways hold. In a court of law all that is required is proof ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. In mathematics we have to go beyond any possible doubt. Here are two cautionary examples: Example. If we evaluate the quadratic expression P (n) = n 2 + n + 41 for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . we ﬁnd that P (0) = 41, which is prime, P (1) = 43, which is prime, P (2) = 47 which is prime, P (3) = 9 + 3 + 41 = 53 which is prime, etc. If we try any integer n between 0 and 39 inclusive, we will ﬁnd that P (n) is prime. We might easily conclude that the result would always be a prime number. However, P (40) = 41 2, and so the general result does not in fact hold. Example. Fermat numbers are integers of the form Fn = 22n + 1, where n are non- negative integers. These numbers were ﬁrst studied by Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), who conjectured that all Fermat numbers are prime. Indeed, the ﬁrst ﬁve Fermat numbers F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, F4 = 65537 are easily seen to be primes. However, in 1732 Leonhard Euler refuted the conjecture by computing the number F5 and showing that it is composite. Proving mathematical statements is part science and part art. There are some tech- niques but there is no method which would be suﬃciently general to help you with every problem. Proofs require a great deal of insight and creativity and above all, hard work. As you get more experience with proofs, you will get better at it. Below are some examples of proofs. 4.3 Proving that two sets are equal Let A and B be two sets. Earlier we saw that A = B if and only if both A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A. This is a common way of proving that the two sets are equal. Here are two examples: Theorem 4.1. Let A = {n ∈ N : n is even}, B = {n ∈ N : n is divisible by 3}, C = {n ∈ N : n is divisible by 6}. Then C = A ∩ B. Proof. 1. Let us show that C ⊂ A ∩ B. If n is divisible by 6, then clearly n is even and n is divisible by 3. So n ∈ A ∩ B, as required. 2. Let us show that A ∩ B ⊂ C. Suppose that n is even and n is divisible by 3. Write n = 3k with an integer k. Since n is even, k must also be even. Thus, k = 2ℓ with some integer ℓ. It follows that n = 3k = 6ℓ, and so n ∈ C, as required. Theorem 4.2. For any sets A, B, and C, we have (i) A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C); (ii) A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C). 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 22 Proof. (i) We must show that lhs ⊂ rhs and rhs ⊂ lhs (lhs = left hand side, rhs = right hand side). 1. Let us show that lhs ⊂ rhs. If lhs = ∅, we are done, because ∅ is a subset of any set. So now suppose that lhs ̸= ∅ and let x ∈ lhs = A ∪ (B ∩ C). Then x ∈ A or x ∈ (B ∩ C) (or both). Case 1: Suppose x ∈ A. Then x ∈ A ∪ B and also x ∈ A ∪ C and therefore x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C), that is, x ∈ rhs. Case 2: Suppose that x ∈ (B ∩ C). Then x ∈ B and x ∈ C and so x ∈ A ∪ B and also x ∈ A ∪ C. Therefore x ∈ (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C), that is, x ∈ rhs. So in either case (1) or (2) (and at least one of these must be true), we ﬁnd that x ∈ rhs. Since x ∈ lhs is arbitrary, we deduce that every element of the lhs is also an element of the rhs, that is lhs ⊂ rhs. 2. Let us show that rhs ⊂ lhs. If rhs = ∅, then there is no more to prove. So suppose that rhs ̸= ∅, and let x ∈ rhs. Then x ∈ A ∪ B and x ∈ A ∪ C. Case 1: suppose x ∈ A. Then x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C) and so x ∈ lhs. Case 2: suppose x /∈ A. Then since x ∈ A ∪ B, we must have x ∈ B. Also x ∈ A ∪ C and so it follows that x ∈ C. Hence x ∈ B ∩ C and so x ∈ A ∪ (B ∩ C) which means that x ∈ lhs. Thus, rhs ⊂ lhs. Combining these two parts, we have lhs = rhs as required. (ii) is left as an exercise. Note that the symbol above denotes the end of proof. This symbol is used in mathe- matical texts to render the proofs more visible in the text. 4.4 Proof by induction This is a common method of proof; it is discussed in the Calculus course so we will not duplicate this discussion here. 4.5 Proof by contradiction We will often prove mathematical statements by using the following trick. If we have to prove that A is true, we will ﬁrst suppose that A is false and then, using a chain of logical implications, come to a conclusion which is deﬁnitely false. In this way we show that our initial assumption (A is false) was wrong, so A must be true. Proof by contradiction is essentially replacing a statement A ⇒ B by its contrapositive NOT B ⇒ NOT A. Proof by contradiction is used particularly often with uniqueness statements; see e.g. the proof of uniqueness of maximum in the next section. 4.6 Proof by constructing a counterexample Let us discuss an example. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 23 Proposition A: For all natural numbers n, the expression 2n2 − 20n + 49 is positive. You need to ﬁnd out whether Proposition A is true or false. First you try to prove it and fail. You suspect that the proposition might be false. You try substituting particular values of n and after trying n = 1, 2, 3, 4, (which give positive values to our expression) you discover that for n = 5 the expression is negative: 2 × 5 2 − 20 × 5 + 49 = −1. Thus, the proposition is false. One says that the case n = 5 is a counterexample to Proposition A. We have proven that Proposition A is false by constructing a counterexample. 4.7 Further examples of proofs Here we will prove several simple statements concerning unions and intersections of sets. This serves two purposes: ﬁrstly, it provides some examples of proofs and secondly, it introduces some important ideas which we will see again soon when we discuss convergence of sequences. Theorem 4.3. One has ∞⋃ n=1 (−n, n) = R. Proof. We need to prove that lhs ⊂ rhs and rhs ⊂ lhs. Since (−n, n) ⊂ R for all n ∈ N, the ﬁrst statement is obvious. Let us prove the second statement: rhs ⊂ lhs. Take any x ∈ R; we need to prove that x ∈ lhs. By the deﬁnition of union, for any x ∈ R we need to prove that there exists a positive integer n such that x ∈ (−n, n). The easiest way to do it is to explicitly specify this integer n in terms of x. Consider two cases: Case 1: x ≥ 0. Take n = ⌈x⌉ + 1. Then 0 ≤ x < n and so x ∈ (−n, n). Thus, x ∈ lhs. Case 2: x < 0. Take n = ⌈−x⌉ + 1. Then n > −x, so −n < x < 0 and so x ∈ (−n, n). Thus, x ∈ lhs. Theorem 4.4. One has ∞⋂ n=1 (−1/n, 1/n) = {0}. Proof. As usual, we need to prove that lhs ⊂ rhs and rhs ⊂ lhs. First note that 0 ∈ (−1/n, 1/n) for all n ∈ N, and therefore 0 ∈ lhs. Thus, rhs ⊂ lhs. Let us prove that lhs ⊂ rhs. We need to prove that if x ∈ lhs then x = 0. We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose x ∈ lhs and x ̸= 0. Consider two cases: Case 1: x > 0. Consider the number 1/x > 0 and let us take n = ⌈1/x⌉ + 1. Then n is a positive integer and n > 1/x, and so x > 1/n. It follows that x /∈ (−1/n, 1/n) (for this choice of n) and therefore x /∈ lhs. Case 2: x < 0. Consider the number −1/x > 0 and let us take n = ⌈−1/x⌉ + 1. Then n is a positive integer and n > −1/x, and so x < −1/n. It follows that x /∈ (−1/n, 1/n) (for this choice of n) and therefore x /∈ lhs. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 24 In either of the two cases, we have obtained a contradiction. Thus, our initial assumption x ̸= 0 cannot be true. 4.8 Common mistakes Here we refer to the excellent website “The most common errors in undergraduate mathe- matics”: http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/commerrs/ See the section ERRORS IN REASONING on this website. Here we would like to particularly emphasise the common mistake of “working back- wards”. Below is an example of “proof” of the statement “∀n ∈ Z one has n ≥ 1” from this website: ‹ Let n ∈ Z. Assume n ≥ 1. ‹ Rearrange to n − 1 ≥ 0. ‹ Since the l.h.s. is positive, we can multiply both sides by n − 1. We get (n − 1) 2 ≥ 0. ‹ Since a square of any number is always non-negative, the inequality (n − 1) 2 ≥ 0 is true. Thus, the assumption n ≥ 1 must also be true. What is wrong with this proof? Let A be the statement “∀n ∈ N one has n ≥ 1” and let B be the statement “∀n ∈ N one has (n − 1)2 ≥ 0”. We have proven that A ⇒ B is true and that B is true. Does it follow that A is true? 4.9 Some general advice If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it? Albert Einstein Although in some cases you will immediately be able to see how to construct a proof, generally when presented with a theorem and asked to provide a proof the ﬁrst question is ‘where do I start?’ There is no ﬁxed routine, recipe or algorithm. But there are strategies which it is advisable to adopt, which are summarised in the following list. 1. Make sure you have enough time and plenty of rough paper. 2. Write down the statement of the theorem you are required to prove. 3. Make sure you really understand the deﬁnitions of all the mathematical objects which appear in this statement. If you don’t, go back to these deﬁnitions and revise. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 25 4. Test the theorem by trying some special cases. 5. Try to ﬁnd an example which contradicts the theorem. (This should be impossible, but trying to do this is often an eﬀective way of seeing why a result has to be true.) 6. Write down mathematical facts which might be related to the theorem you are trying to prove. 7. Rewrite the statement of the theorem in several diﬀerent ways. 8. Now try to prove the theorem and be persistent! As well as these practical steps, remember that you need to really concentrate on the issue, get under its skin so to speak; you won’t make any progress if half your mind is on the television or your supper. And believe in your ability to prove the result. Don’t be feeble and give up. Once you think you have the beginnings of an idea, start trying to set it down. You may have a few false starts. When you think you have ﬁnished, read through your proof critically, make sure you really have set down a logical chain of reasons from the assumptions at the beginning to the conclusion at the end. Try to simplify your proof or construct a diﬀerent, simpler argument. Do not become discouraged if constructing proofs seems diﬃcult. It is diﬃcult for nearly everyone. Don’t be deceived by the form in which mathematicians generally display their ﬁnished products. Behind a polished proof there has often been a great deal of struggle and frustration and ruined paper. There is no other way to discover good mathematics, and for most of us there is no other way to learn it. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 26 5 Real Numbers: Introduction God created the integers; all else is the work of man Leopold Kronecker There are two possible approaches to the rigorous study of real numbers. In some mathematical courses, one starts with the natural numbers N, then constructs integers Z (by adding the negatives of natural numbers), then constructs rational numbers (as ratios of integers) and ﬁnally, by some limiting procedure, one constructs irrational numbers. This gives the whole set of real numbers by means of some constructive procedure. Another approach is to set the axioms of real numbers and then to derive the usual properties from these axioms. See, for example, Ivan Wilde’s lecture notes in Analysis quoted on the course website. In this introductory course, we will not follow consistently either of these rigorous ap- proaches. Instead, we will brieﬂy discuss basic properties of real numbers and then proceed to use them relying on our intuition and experience. 5.1 Arithmetic and order We will use the usual rules of arithmetics to add, subtract, multiply and divide real numbers. We shall not question or analyse these rules but simply use them in an intuitively clear way. One thing worth reminding is that dividing by zero is not a valid operation: x 0 , 1 0 , 0 0 are NOT DEFINED! It is NOT TRUE that 1 0 = ∞! There is a relation < (“less than”) between elements of R such that for any a, b ∈ R, exactly one of the following is true: a < b, b < a, or a = b. Of course, the notation a > b means b < a. The relation < satisﬁes the following properties (axioms of order): ‹ If a < b and b < c then a < c. ‹ If a < b, then a + c < b + c for any c ∈ R. ‹ If a < b and c > 0, then ac < bc. All the usual properties of inequalities can be derived from these ones. For convenience, we list some of these properties on the next page (which can be printed out separately and used as reference material). 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 27 Inequalities: some rules of manipulation 1. You can multiply an inequality by any positive number α: x < y ⇔ αx < αy (if α > 0), x ≤ y ⇔ αx ≤ αy (if α > 0). 2. You can multiply an inequality by any negative number α and reverse the sign of the inequality (i.e. replace < by > and vice versa): x < y ⇔ αx > αy (if α < 0), x ≤ y ⇔ αx ≥ αy (if α < 0). Common mistake: forgetting to reverse the sign. For example, one writes −2x > 6 ⇒ x > −3 (wrong!) 3. If x, y are both non-negative numbers, you can square the inequality x < y: x < y ⇔ x2 < y2 (if x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0), x ≤ y ⇔ x2 ≤ y2 (if x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). Common mistake: forgetting the requirements x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0. For example, one writes −2 < x ⇒ 4 < x 2 (wrong!) 4. If x, y are both non-negative numbers, you can take a square root of both sides of the inequality x < y: x < y ⇔ √ x < √y (if x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0), x ≤ y ⇔ √ x ≤ √ y (if x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0). 5. More generally, if x, y are both positive numbers, you can raise the inequality x < y to any positive power p > 0: x < y ⇔ xp < yp (if x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and p > 0), x ≤ y ⇔ xp ≤ yp (if x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and p > 0). 6. If x, y are both positive numbers, you can replace x and y in the inequality x < y by their inverses 1/x, 1/y and reverse the sign of the inequality: x < y ⇔ 1 x > 1 y (if x > 0 and y > 0), x ≤ y ⇔ 1 x ≥ 1 y (if x > 0 and y > 0). 7. If x, y are both positive numbers, you can take natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality: x < y ⇔ ln x < ln y (if x > 0 and y > 0), x ≤ y ⇔ ln x ≤ ln y (if x > 0 and y > 0). 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 28 5.2 Equations and inequalities To solve an equation (resp. inequality) involving a variable means to list all possible values of this variable such that the equation (resp. inequality) becomes true. Example. 1. x2 − x = 0. Solution: x ∈ {0, 1}. 2. x2 < 4. Solution: x ∈ (−2, 2). Often there are inﬁnitely many solutions, so “listing” the values should be understood as “describing in an explicit way”. Usually this is done by using the set theoretic notation discussed above. Example. 1. x2 > 2. Solution: x ∈ (−∞, − √2) ∪ (√ 2, ∞). 2. (x − 1) 2 ≤ 9. Solution: x ∈ [−2, 4]. Sometimes one is asked to ﬁnd only the solutions (to a given inequality) in a given range, for example “Solve the inequality (x − 1) 2 ≤ 9 for x > 0”. Solution: x ∈ (0, 4]. 5.3 Equations with parameters Sometimes the equation or inequality that you need to solve contains an unknown param- eter. Then this parameter will most likely appear in your answer. Example. Let a ∈ R. Solve the equation (x−a) 2 = 4 for x ∈ R. Answer: x ∈ {a+2, a−2}. Sometimes you have to consider diﬀerent cases, depending on the value of your param- eter. Example. Let a ∈ R. Solve the inequality ax − a2 ≥ 0 for x ∈ R. Solution: Consider three cases: Case 1: a > 0. Then ax − a 2 ≥ 0 ⇔ x − a ≥ 0 ⇔ x ≥ a ⇔ x ∈ [a, ∞). Case 2: a < 0. Then ax − a2 ≥ 0 ⇔ x − a ≤ 0 ⇔ x ≤ a ⇔ x ∈ (−∞, a]. Case 3: a = 0. Then ax − a2 = 0 ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R, so all x ∈ R are solutions to our inequality. Answer: If a > 0, the solution is x ∈ [a, ∞). If a < 0, the solution is x ∈ (−∞, a]. If a = 0, the solution is x ∈ R. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 29 5.4 Roots In this course we deal only with real numbers, and therefore we consider the expression √x only for x ≥ 0. If you’ve seen complex numbers, you may remember that i is sometimes written as √−1. However, from our point of view here the number i is “outside of our world”, so we declare √−1 (and generally square roots of negative numbers) to be ill- deﬁned. Deﬁnition 5.1. For x ≥ 0, the square root of x, a = √x, is the (unique) NON-NEGATIVE solution to the equation a2 = x. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to the above equation is not diﬃcult to prove, but we will not discuss this in this course. There is often some confusion about the deﬁnition of the square root. You may remem- ber that the set of solutions to x2 = 4, for example, is x = 2 and x = −2. But this does NOT mean that √4 has two values, 2 and −2. (Within the realm of complex numbers, the conventions are diﬀerent, but this is another story!) So, in our course: √x is always NON-NEGATIVE! √4 ̸= −2 However, when you solve the equation x2 = 4, you have indeed two solutions: x = √4 = 2 and x = − √4 = −2. Similarly, if n is a positive integer and x ≥ 0, then a = n√x = x1/n is deﬁned as the unique positive solution to the equation an = x. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the above equation is not diﬃcult to prove, but it is beyond the scope of this course. 5.5 Modulus We will often work with modulus, or absolute value. It is very important that you know the deﬁnition and rules of manipulation with modulus. Deﬁnition 5.2. For x ∈ R, the modulus of x, |x|, is deﬁned as |x| = { x if x ≥ 0, −x if x < 0. By deﬁnition, modulus is always non-negative: |2| = 2 > 0, |−5| = −(−5) = 5 > 0, |0| = 0. Here are some properties of the modulus function: 1. ∀x, y ∈ R: |xy| = |x||y|; in particular, |ax| = a|x| if a > 0; 2. ∀x, y ∈ R: |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| (the triangle inequality); 3. ∀x, y ∈ R: |x − y| ≤ |x| + |y| (another form of the triangle inequality). 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 30 These properties can be easily proven from the deﬁnition of modulus. Let us, for example, present the proof of the ﬁrst of these properties in a theorem-proof style. Theorem 5.3. Let x, y ∈ R. Then |xy| = |x||y|. Proof. We give a proof by exhaustion, i.e., prove the result separately for an exhaustive list of possible cases for x. The fact that the deﬁnition of modulus is given in terms of cases gives us this idea. Case 1: suppose that x = 0. Then |x| = 0 and |xy| = |0| = 0 and so the statement to be proven becomes 0 · |y| = 0 which is obviously true. Case 2: the case y = 0 is considered in the same way. Case 3: let x > 0, y > 0. Then also xy > 0. We have |x| = x, |y| = y, |xy| = xy, so the statement to be proven becomes xy = xy, which is obviously true. Case 4: let x > 0, y < 0. Then xy < 0. We have |x| = x, |y| = −y, |xy| = −xy, so the statement to be proven becomes x · (−y) = −xy, which is obviously true. Case 5: let x < 0, y > 0. This case is considered in the same way as Case 4. Case 6: let x < 0, y < 0. Then xy > 0. We have |x| = −x, |y| = −y, |xy| = xy, so the statement to be proven becomes (−x) · (−y) = xy, which is obviously true. At a practical level, we will need to solve simple equations and inequalities involving modulus. You should remember that: 1. if a > 0, then the equation |x| = a has solutions x = a and x = −a; 2. if a > 0, then the inequality |x| < a has the solution x ∈ (−a, a); 3. if a > 0, then the inequality |x| > a has the solution x ∈ (−∞, −a) ∪ (a, ∞). What is the set of solutions of |x| ≤ a? Of |x| ≥ a? Examples: 1. Solve |x − 7| = 2. Answer: x ∈ {5, 9}. 2. Solve |x| ≤ 3. Answer: x ∈ [−3, 3]. 3. Solve |x − 2| > 5. Answer: x ∈ (−∞, −3) ∪ (7, ∞). 4. Solve |−3x| < 6. Answer: x ∈ (−2, 2). 5. Solve |2x2| ≤ 8. Answer: x ∈ [−2, 2]. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 31 5.6 Irrational Numbers Are all numbers rational? The following theorem was discovered in the Pythagorean school in the IVth or Vth century BC. Theorem 5.4. There is no rational number x that satisﬁes the equation x2 = 2. Proof. We shall give the classic proof by contradiction. Suppose (a/b)2 = 2 where a and b are integers which we may assume have no common factors. We have a2 = 2b2 and so a2, and hence a itself, is divisible by 2. We may therefore write a = 2c for some integer c. Squaring gives a 2 = 4c2. But a2 = 2b2 and so b2 = 2c2. We now have b2, and hence b itself, is divisible by 2. We have shown that both a and b are divisible by 2. This contradicts to them having no common factor. Hence our assumption that we can write (a/b) 2 = 2 must be false. There are many more irrational numbers! Indeed most real numbers are irrational, in a certain precise mathematical sense. We will not discuss this. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 32 6 Boundedness; supremum and inﬁmum Up to now, we have been discussing some basic preliminary material which is common to all branches of mathematics. From now on, in this course we will be studying topics which provide the foundations of Analysis. 6.1 Boundedness Deﬁnition 6.1 (bounded above/below, upper/lower bound). A subset S of R is said to be bounded above if there is a real number M such that x ≤ M for all x ∈ S. Alternatively: S is bounded above if S ⊂ (−∞, M ] for some M ∈ R. Such a number M is called an upper bound for S. A subset S of R is said to be bounded below if there is a real number m such that x ≥ m for all x ∈ S. Alternatively: S is bounded below if S ⊂ [m, ∞) for some m ∈ R. Such a number m is called a lower bound for S. A subset S of R is said to be bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below. Alternatively: S is bounded if S ⊂ [m, M ] for some real numbers m, M . If S is not bounded, it is called unbounded. As an exercise you should prove that a subset S of R is bounded if and only if there exists a real number H such that |x| ≤ H for all x ∈ S. Example. 1. The set N is bounded from below but not bounded from above. The numbers −1/2, 0, 1 are lower bounds for N. 2. The set S = {−n2 | n ∈ N} is bounded from above but not bounded from below. Any number in the interval [−1, ∞) can be taken for an upper bound of S. 3. The set Z is unbounded from below and from above. 4. The set S = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . . } is bounded. All numbers from [1, ∞) are upper bounds for S and all numbers from (−∞, 0] are lower bounds for S. We shall often meet sets which are made up of the elements of a sequence of real numbers. In the last example, the sequence is sn = 1/n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , and the set S = {sn | n ∈ N}. Proving that a set is bounded above (or below) is often not diﬃcult: you need to exhibit an upper bound for this set. Proving that a set is unbounded above (or below) is slightly more diﬃcult. Let us consider this question for boundedness above. Let us write down the deﬁnition of boundedness above of a set S by using the quantiﬁers: ∃M ∈ R such that ∀x ∈ S one has x ≤ M. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 33 Using our rules of negating the propositions, we obtain the following deﬁnition of S being unbounded above: ∀M ∈ R ∃x ∈ S such that x > M. Let us prove that N is unbounded above. Given M ∈ R, we need to ﬁnd a natural number n ∈ N such that n > M . Consider two cases: Case 1: M ≤ 0. Then we can take, for example, n = 1. Case 2: M > 0. Let us take n = ⌈M ⌉ + 1. Then, clearly, n ∈ N and n > M . So in either case, we have found n > M as required. Example. Let us prove that the set S = {2 n | n ∈ Z} is unbounded above. As above, we need to prove that for any M ∈ R there exists x ∈ S such that x > M . That is, given any M ∈ R we need to ﬁnd n ∈ Z such that 2n > M . Consider two cases: Case 1: M ≤ 0. Then we can take, for example, n = 0: M ≤ 2 0 = 1. Case 2: M > 0. Take n = ⌈log2(M )⌉ + 1. Then, clearly, n ∈ Z and 2n > M , as required. In the exercises, you are asked to apply the same reasoning to the proof of unboundedness of more complicated sets. 6.2 Maximum and minimum Deﬁnition 6.2. Let S be bounded above and suppose that there exists an upper bound M of S such that M ∈ S. Then M is called the maximum of S (or the maximal element of S): M = max S. Let S be bounded below and suppose that there exists a lower bound m of S such that m ∈ S. Then m is called the minimum of S (or the minimal element of S): m = min S. Example. 1. For the set S = [1, ∞), one has min S = 1. 2. For the set N, one has min N = 1. 3. For the set [1, 2], one has max S = 2, min S = 1. 4. For the set S = {1/n | n ∈ N}, one has max S = 1. Does min S exist? Let us prove that in the last example, min S does not exist. We use proof by contra- diction. Assume that min S exists; denote it by m. Since m ∈ S, it must be of the form m = 1/k for some k ∈ N. Consider the number 1/(k + 1). Clearly, 1/(k + 1) ∈ S and 1 k + 1 < 1 k = m. (6.1) On the other hand, by the deﬁnition of minimum, we must have m ≤ x for all x ∈ S; this contradicts (6.1). Thus, min S does not exist. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 34 Example. The set S = (0, 1) is bounded. However, neither maximum nor minimum exist for this set. Let us prove that max S does not exist. Suppose to the contrary that M = max S exists. Consider the number M1 = (M + 1)/2. Since M ∈ S, we have 0 < M < 1 ⇒ 0 < M + 1 < 2 ⇒ 0 < M1 < 1 ⇒ M1 ∈ S. Also M < 1 ⇒ 2M < M + 1 ⇒ M < M1. Thus, we have found an element M1 ∈ S such that M < M1, so M cannot be a maximum of S – contradiction! The proof that min S in the above example does not exist is left as an exercise. Thus, we see that maximum and minimum may not exist even for a bounded set. However, one has Theorem 6.3. (i) Let S be bounded above. If max S exists, then it is unique. (ii) Let S be bounded below. If min S exists, then it is unique. Proof. We shall prove only part (i). Suppose that M1 ̸= M2 are two diﬀerent maxima of S. As M1 is an upper bound for S and M2 is an element of S, we get M1 ≥ M2. Interchanging the roles of M1 and M2, we get M2 ≥ M1. Thus, M1 = M2 — contradiction! 6.3 Supremum and inﬁmum As we have just seen, maximum and minimum may not exist even for bounded sets. Below we discuss a proper substitute for maximum and minimum. Consider the set (0, 1). Clearly, 1 is a candidate for a substitute for maximum. Similarly, 0 could be taken as a substitute for minimum. Deﬁnition 6.4. Let S be bounded below. Suppose that there exists the largest number m such that S ⊂ [m, ∞). Then m is called the greatest lower bound for S, or the inﬁmum of S, denoted inf S. In our example, S = (0, 1), we have S ⊂ [0, ∞). In fact, 0 is the largest number m such that S ⊂ [m, ∞). Let us prove this by contradiction. Suppose there exists m > 0 such that S ⊂ [m, ∞). Clearly, we must have m < 1. Consider the number m/2; then m/2 < m and m/2 ∈ S; this contradicts to S ⊂ [m, ∞). The above deﬁnition can be rephrased as follows: inf S is the maximum of the set of all lower bounds of S. Since maximum of any set is unique, the inﬁmum of any set is uniquely deﬁned. The greatest lower bound is characterized by two properties: (i) it is a lower bound; (ii) it is greater than any other lower bound. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 35 Example. 1. inf[1, 2] = min[1, 2] = 1. 2. For any a < b, one has inf(a, b) = inf[a, b) = inf(a, b] = inf[a, b] = a. 3. For S = {1/n | n ∈ N}, one has inf S = 0, and min S does not exist. You should think of inﬁmum as of the ‘grown-ups’ version of minimum. Theorem 6.5. Let S be bounded from below. If min S exists, then inf S also exists and coincides with min S. Proof. Let m = min S. Let us prove that m = inf S. We need to prove that (i) m is a lower bound for S; (ii) if m1 is another lower bound for S, then m1 < m. The statement (i) follows from the deﬁnition of minumum. In order to prove (ii), argue by contradiction: suppose that there is a lower bound m1 > m; this is impossible, as m is an element of S and so m should be greater than or equal to any lower bound. Thus, inﬁmum is a satisfactory substitute for minimum. Of course, there is a similar substitute for maximum: Deﬁnition 6.6. Let S be bounded above. Suppose that there exists the smallest number M such that S ⊂ (−∞, M ]. Then M is called the least upper bound for S, or the supremum of S, denoted sup S. Again, the least upper bound is characterized by two properties: (i) it is an upper bound; (ii) it is less than any other upper bound. As an exercise, you should prove that if a maximum of a set exists, then its supremum also exists and coincides with the maximum. Example. 1. For any a < b, one has sup(a, b) = sup[a, b) = sup(a, b] = sup[a, b] = b. 2. For S = {1 − 2 −n | n ∈ N}, one has inf S = min S = 1/2, sup S = 1, but max S does not exist. The following property of inf S and sup S is simple to prove yet very important: Theorem 6.7. (i) Let S ⊂ R be a set bounded above and let M = sup S. Then for any ε > 0 there exists x ∈ S such that M − ε < x. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 36 (ii) Let S ⊂ R be a set bounded below and let m = inf S. Then for any ε > 0 there exists x ∈ S such that x < m + ε. Proof. (i) We have M − ε < M . Since M is the LEAST upper bound of S, the number M −ε is NOT an upper bound of S. This means that there exists x ∈ S such that x ≤ M −ε is FALSE. That is, there exists x ∈ S such that x > M − ε, as required. (ii) is left as an exercise. Example. Consider the set S = (a, b); here b = sup S. Let ε > 0 be given; let us ﬁnd x ∈ S such that b − ε < x. Consider two cases: Case 1: ε ≥ b − a. Then b − ε ≤ a and therefore we can take for x any element of the interval (a, b). For example, the midpoint x = (b − a)/2 will do. Case 2: ε < b − a. Then b − ε ∈ (a, b). We can take for x the midpoint of (b − ε, b), i.e. x = b − (ε/2). Clearly, x ∈ (a, b) and b − ε < x. Example. Let S = {1/n | n ∈ N}; then inf S = 0. Let ε > 0 be given; let us ﬁnd x ∈ S such that x < ε. That is, we need to ﬁnd n ∈ N such that 1/n < ε. We can equivalently rewrite this as n > 1/ε. Now it is clear that if we take n = ⌈1/ε⌉ + 1, then we get n > 1/ε, and therefore 1/n < ε, as required. 6.4 Completeness In our examples, we have always been able to ﬁnd supremum and inﬁmum of a bounded set (although maximum and minimum may not exist). This is a consequence of a fundamental property of real numbers: completeness. This property cannot be deduced from any other axioms of real numbers and must be accepted as an independent axiom. Deﬁnition 6.8 (Axiom of completeness). Every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded above has a supremum. Every nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded from below has an inﬁmum. It is this property that distinguishes real numbers from rational numbers. More precisely, rational numbers satisfy all the usual properties of arithmetics and order, but they do not satisfy the completeness axiom. Indeed, the set {x ∈ Q | x2 < 2} does not have a supremum or inﬁmum in the set of rational numbers; the supremum and inﬁmum are √ 2 and −√ 2, which are irrational. You can think of Q as of a line with some elements (irrational numbers) missing, whereas R has no “missing elements”. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 37 7 Sequences: Convergence Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. Albert Einstein The notion of convergence is conceptually the most important in the whole Numbers and Functions course. Once you really understand what convergence means for sequences the rest is easy! 7.1 Sequences We shall deal with inﬁnite sequences of real numbers: s1, s2, s3, . . . One can specify a sequence either by giving a general formula, e.g. sn = 1 n2 n ∈ N, or by writing out the ﬁrst several terms of the sequence so that the pattern is clear, e.g. 1, 1 4 , 1 9 , 1 16, 1 25, . . . Sometimes it is convenient to start labelling a sequence not from n = 1, but from a diﬀerent integer n0. For example, sn = 1/ log n is not deﬁned for n = 1, so it is convenient to consider this sequence for n = 2, 3, 4, . . . ; so here n0 = 2. Notation: Strictly speaking, a proper piece of notation for a sequence is {sn} ∞ n=n0 (some- times written alternatively as (sn)n≥n0). But we will usually just write something like “let sn be a sequence”, assuming that n takes natural values unless explicitly stated otherwise. 7.2 Convergence: deﬁnition First consider an example of the sequence sn = 1/n. We know that sn gets closer and closer to zero as n grows. Let us try to make this statement precise. We would like to say that sn gets as small as we want for suﬃciently large n. How small? Fix a margin of error 0.01. How large do we have to take n to make sure that 1/n ≈ 0 within the margin of error 0.01? More precisely, how large do we have to take n to make sure that 1/n < 0.01? Obviously, it suﬃces to take n > 100. Next, let the margin of error be ε = 0.001. Then, taking n > 1000, we can guarantee that 1/n < ε. In general, suppose we are given an arbitrary small number ε > 0. Then, taking n > 1/ε, we ensure that 1/n < ε. Of course, the smaller ε we are given, the larger n we have to take to make sure that 1/n < ε. This motivates the following deﬁnition, which is the most important deﬁnition you will ever need to know in this course. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 38 Deﬁnition 7.1 (convergent). The sequence sn is said to converge to the limit ℓ if for all ε > 0 there exists a natural number n0 such that for all n ≥ n0 we have |sn − ℓ| < ε . Note that n0 will depend on ε. The smaller ε is the larger n0 will usually have to be. You can think of n0 as of a function of ε, i.e. n0 = n0(ε). Also note that there are three quantiﬁers in this deﬁnition and that their order of appearance is crucial to the meaning. If you do not state the quantiﬁers or get them in the wrong order then your deﬁnition is wrong. In symbols the deﬁnition is: ∀ε > 0 ∃n0 ∈ N such that ∀n ≥ n0 we have |sn − ℓ| < ε. (7.1) For brevity, when sn converges to ℓ, we write lim n→∞ sn = ℓ or sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Also, for brevity, sometimes we even drop the “n → ∞”, and just say sn → ℓ. Sometimes we just say that |sn − ℓ| < ε for n suﬃciently large in the deﬁnition without specifying the value n0 beyond which the inequality is always true. Let us consider some examples of sequences that converge to zero, i.e. ℓ = 0. Example. 1. Consider the sequences sn = 1 n , sn = − 1 n , sn = (−1)n n . For all these sequences, we have |sn| = 1 n < ε if n ≥ 1 ε . Thus, for all these sequences we can take n0(ε) = ⌈1/ε⌉ + 1. Note that the values of the ﬁrst sequence are always greater than the limit 0, the values of the second one are always smaller than the limit, and the values of the third one are alternatively greater and smaller than the limit for even and odd n. 2. Consider the sequence sn = 2+(−1)n n . Here we have |sn| ≤ 3 n < ε as soon as n > 3 ε . So we can take n0(ε) = ⌈3/ε⌉ + 1. Note that here the values of sn alternatively get closer to the limit and further away from the limit: sn = 1, 3 2 , 1 3, 3 4, 1 5 , 3 6 , . . . 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 39 3. Consider the sequence sn = 1+(−1)n n . Here we have |sn| ≤ 2 n < ε if n > 2 ε . Thus, we can take n0(ε) = ⌈2/ε⌉ + 1. Note that for odd n the values of the sequence are equal to its limit 0. These simple examples illustrate the multitude of possibilities that are covered by the deﬁnition of convergence. It doesn’t matter whether the values of sn are all on one side of the limit; it doesn’t matter if sn gets closer to the limit at every step; it doesn’t matter whether sn takes the values equal to the actual limit. Example. 1. 1√n → 0 as n → ∞. 2. 1 n2 → 0 as n → ∞. 3. 1 2n → 0 as n → ∞. 4. sn = 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, . . . . That is, s1 = 1 and sn = 0 for all n ≥ 2. Then sn → 0 as n → ∞. 7.3 Convergence: discussion and further examples In order to fully appreciate the deﬁnition of convergence, let us discuss the situation when convergence does NOT hold. The negation of the deﬁnition of convergence is: ∃ε > 0 such that ∀n0 ∈ N ∃n ≥ n0 such that |sn − ℓ| ≥ ε. Example. 1. The sequence sn = (−1) n does NOT converge to 0. Indeed, take ε = 1/2. For a given n0 ∈ N, take any n > n0. Then |(−1) n| = 1 > ε. 2. Consider the sequence sn = 1+(−1)n 2 , i.e. sn = 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, . . . . This sequence does NOT converge to 0. Indeed, take ε = 1/2. For a given n0 ∈ N, take any even n > n0. Then |sn| = 1 > ε. Let us look at some further examples of convergent sequences: Example. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 40 1. For any k ∈ N and a ∈ R, a nk → 0 as n → ∞. The same holds true for any k ∈ R, k > 0. 2. It is a trivial consequence of the deﬁnition (but nevertheless a useful fact) that sn → 0 if and only if |sn| → 0 as n → ∞. 3. For any A ∈ (−1, 1), one has A n → 0 as n → ∞. 4. Let sn = 1/ log n, n ≥ 2. Then sn → 0 as n → ∞. 5. n n+1 → 1 as n → ∞. 6. n2 2n2+1 → 1 2 as n → ∞. Note that according to our deﬁnition of convergence, to ﬁnd out whether a given se- quence is convergent you need to know in advance the limit ℓ. Just so that we can be absolutely sure we are talking about the limit we had better prove the following theorem. Theorem 7.2. Every convergent sequence has one and only one limit. Proof. Let us use a proof by contradiction. Suppose sn is a convergent sequence with two limits ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2. Using, say, 1 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2| as a value for ε around one of these points, ℓ1, we have that there exists n1 such that |sn − ℓ1| < 1 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2| for all n ≥ n1. In the same way, we obtain that there exists n2 such that |sn − ℓ2| < 1 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2| for all n ≥ n2. Then for all n ≥ max{n1, n2} using the triangle inequality we obtain |ℓ1 − ℓ2| = |ℓ1 − sn + sn − ℓ2| ≤ |ℓ1 − sn| + |ℓ2 − sn| < 1 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2| + 1 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2| = 2 3|ℓ1 − ℓ2|, which is impossible. 7.4 Divergence Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. L. Tolstoy, Anna Karenina Deﬁnition 7.3 (divergent). If the sequence sn does not converge to any limit it is said to diverge. Note that this deﬁnition might not accord with what you were expecting. You might have been expecting the particular kind of divergence as in the following deﬁnition. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 41 Deﬁnition 7.4 (divergence to inﬁnity). The sequence sn is said to diverge to +∞, for which we write sn → +∞, if, for every positive real number H, there exists n0 such that for all n ≥ n0 we have sn > H . The sequence sn is said to diverge to −∞, for which we write sn → −∞, if, for any negative real number H, there exists n0 such that for all n ≥ n0 we have sn < H . Note that we use the same notation as above: sn → +∞ looks like sn → ℓ, but the deﬁnition is diﬀerent. The reason is because we like to use the symbol ∞ as if it represented a real number. It does not! Again, the symbol ∞ is merely part of our shorthand notation. The deﬁnition of divergence to +∞ is similar in spirit to that of convergence: in each case you are given a challenge (ε or H) and are required to ﬁnd a point (n0) beyond which some condition is always satisﬁed. Example. 1. n2 → +∞ as n → ∞. 2. −√ n → −∞ as n → ∞. Let sn be a sequence. Consider the following possibilities: • sn converges; • sn diverges to +∞; • sn diverges to −∞. These possibilities are mutually exclusive, i.e. a sequence cannot, for example, diverge to +∞ and diverge to −∞ at the same time (in the exercises, you are asked to prove this). However, this list of possibilities is not exhaustive, i.e. there are sequences that neither converge nor diverge to +∞ or −∞. In some sense, all convergent sequences are alike, whereas there is a great multitude of diﬀerent patterns of divergence. Example. The following sequences neither converge nor diverge to +∞ or −∞: sn = (−1)n; tn = (−1) nn 2; rn = (1 + (−1) n)n. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 42 7.5 Boundedness It is natural to make the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 7.5 (bounded). The sequence sn is said to be bounded if its terms form a bounded set. i.e., if there exists a real number M such that |sn| ≤ M for all n ∈ N. Example. The sequences (−1)n, 1/n, sin(πn/2) are bounded. The sequences n3, (−1) nn are unbounded. Theorem 7.6. Every convergent sequence is bounded. Proof. Let sn be a convergent sequence with limit ℓ. We are looking to ﬁnd a real number M such that |sn| ≤ M for all n ∈ N. We know that we may pick any ε > 0 and be guaranteed that there exists n0 such that |sn − ℓ| ≤ ε for all n ≥ n0. Thus, picking ε = 1 say, there exists n0 ∈ N such that |sn − ℓ| ≤ 1 for all n ≥ n0. Can we use this to bound |sn| itself? We use a familiar trick of adding and subtracting and the triangle inequality to get |sn| = |sn − ℓ + ℓ| ≤ |sn − ℓ| + |ℓ| , and hence deduce that |sn| ≤ 1 + |ℓ| for all n ≥ n0. We must also consider what goes on before n0. However, here there are only a ﬁnite number of terms and so we can immediately say that |sn| ≤ max{|s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sn0−1|} for n < n0 . Putting these two inequalities together we have that |sn| ≤ max{1 + |ℓ|, |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sn0−1|} for all n , and so our desired value for M is max{1 + |ℓ|, |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sn0−1|}. Note that the proof should serve to remind you that ﬁnite sets of real numbers are easy to deal with, but inﬁnite sets are hard. In particular remember that bounded inﬁnite sets of real numbers do not necessarily have maxima and minima. They have suprema and inﬁma, which are not necessarily actually members of the set. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 43 8 The algebra of limits and the sandwich theorem 8.1 The algebra of limits Here we discuss the technique which will allow us to compute limits of rather complicated expressions by reducing the question to much simpler limits. Theorem 8.1 (Algebra of limits). Let sn → ℓ and tn → m as n → ∞. Then 1. for any number α ∈ R, one has αsn → αℓ as n → ∞; 2. sn + tn → ℓ + m as n → ∞ 3. sntn → ℓm as n → ∞ 4. sn/tn → ℓ/m as n → ∞, provided m ̸= 0 and tn ̸= 0 for all n. Proof. We shall only prove parts 2 and 3 here. The proof of parts 1 is a very simple exercise and the proof of part 4 is a slightly more diﬃcult exercise. Part 2: Let ε > 0 be given. We must show that there exists n0 such that |(sn + tn) − (ℓ + m)| < ε for all n ≥ n0 . We know that given any ε1 > 0 there exists n1 such that |sn − ℓ| < ε1 for all n ≥ n1, and that given any ε2 > 0 there exists n2 such that |tn − m| < ε2 for all n ≥ n2. Using the triangle inequality we have |(sn + tn) − (ℓ + m)| = |(sn − ℓ) + (tn − m)| ≤ |sn − ℓ| + |tn − m| . Our goal is to ensure that this expression is less than ε for suﬃciently large n. We shall do this by ensuring that each of the two terms on the right-hand side is less than 1 2ε. If we take ε1 = 1 2ε (which is positive) then there exists n1 such that |sn − ℓ| < 1 2ε for all n ≥ n1. Similarly, taking ε2 = 1 2ε we get that there exists n2 such that |tn − m| < 1 2ε for all n ≥ n2. To ensure that both of these inequalities are satisﬁed we set n0 = max{n1, n2} and see that |(sn + tn) − (ℓ + m)| < ε for all n ≥ n0 as required. Part 3: Let ε > 0 be given. We must show that there exists n0 such that |sntn − ℓm| < ε for all n ≥ n0 . We know that given any ε1 > 0 there exists n1 such that |sn − ℓ| < ε1 for all n ≥ n1, and that given any ε2 > 0 there exists n2 such that |tn − m| < ε2 for all n ≥ n2. We also know that by Theorem 7.6, the sequences sn and tn are bounded: |sn| ≤ L and |tn| ≤ M for some L > 0, M > 0 and all n ∈ N. We have: |sntn − ℓm| = |sntn − snm + snm − ℓm| ≤ |sntn − snm| + |snm − ℓm| ≤ |sn||tn − m| + |m||sn − ℓ| ≤ L|tn − m| + |m||sn − ℓ|. (8.1) 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 44 Let us ﬁrst assume that m ̸= 0. Take ε1 = ε 2|m| and ε2 = ε 2L and set n0 = max{n1(ε1), n2(ε2)}. Then for any n ≥ n0 we have |sntn − ℓm| ≤ L|tn − m| + |m||sn − ℓ| < L ε 2L + |m| ε 2|m| = ε 2 + ε 2 = ε, as required. Finally, if m = 0 then instead of (8.1) we have |sntn − ℓm| ≤ L|tn − m|. Now one can take ε2 = ε/L, n0 = n2 and we again obtain |sntn − ℓm| < ε for all n ≥ n0. Using the algebra of limits, we can tackle a great variety of examples. The general principle is to identify the fastest growing term of your expression and divide by this term. After this, consider each of the resulting terms separately and use the Algebra of Limits. Example. 1. 1 n2 + 5 = 1/n 2 1 + (5/n2) → 0 1 = 0 as n → ∞ 2. n2 + n 2n2 + 3 = 1 + (1/n) 2 + (3/n2) → 1/2 as n → ∞ 3. n + (−1)n 5n − 3 + (1/2) n = 1 + (−1)n n 5 − 3 n + (1/2)n → 1/5 + 0 = 1/5 as n → ∞. 4. 2 n − 1 2n + 5 n = 1 − 2 −n 1 + 2−n 5 n → 1 as n → ∞. 8.2 The Sandwich Theorem Theorem 8.2 (The Sandwich Theorem). Let rn → ℓ and tn → ℓ as n → ∞ and suppose that rn ≤ sn ≤ tn for all n ∈ N. Then sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Proof. Let ε > 0 be given. We know there exist n1 and n2 such that ℓ − ε < rn < ℓ + ε for all n ≥ n1, and ℓ − ε < tn < ℓ + ε for all n ≥ n2. Hence, for n ≥ n0 = max{n1, n2}, ℓ − ε < rn ≤ sn ≤ tn < ℓ + ε, and in particular ℓ − ε < sn < ℓ + ε as required. Example. 1. Let sn = (−1)n/(n + 1). Take rn = −1/n, tn = 1/n. By the Sandwich Theorem, sn → 0 as n → ∞. 2. Let sn = 2n n3+1. Take rn = 0, tn = 2/n 2. Then 0 ≤ 2n n3 + 1 ≤ 2n n3 = 2 n2 , and therefore sn → 0 as n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 45 3. Let sn = 2+3 sin n n2+3 . We have 2 + 3 sin n n2 + 3 ≤ 2 + 3 n2 + 3 ≤ 5 n2 , and 2 + 3 sin n n2 + 3 ≥ 2 − 3 n2 + 3 ≥ − 1 n2 . Thus, − 1 n2 ≤ 2 + 3 sin n n2 + 3 ≤ 3 n2 and therefore sn → 0 as n → ∞. Theorem 8.3. If sn → 0 as n → ∞ and tn is a bounded sequence, then sntn → 0 as n → ∞. Proof. We know that |tn| ≤ M for all n ∈ N. Thus we have −M |sn| ≤ tnsn ≤ M |sn|. By the Algebra of Limits, we have M |sn| → 0 and −M |sn| → 0. By the Sandwich theorem it follows that sntn → 0 as n → ∞. Example. 1. (−1) nn 2 + 2 n3 + 2n = 1 n (−1)n + 2 n2 1 + 2 n2 → 0 as n → ∞. 2. 2 n + 3 3n + 2 = (2/3)n 1 + 3 · 2 −n 1 + 2 · 3−n → 0 as n → ∞. 8.3 Passing to the limit in inequalities Theorem 8.4. Let sn, tn be convergent sequences such that sn ≤ tn for all n ∈ N. Then lim n→∞ sn ≤ lim n→∞ tn. Proof. Denote ℓ = lim n→∞ sn and m = lim n→∞ tn. We know that: ∀ε > 0 ∃n1 = n1(ε) ∈ N such that ∀n ≥ n1 one has |sn − ℓ| < ε; ∀ε > 0 ∃n2 = n2(ε) ∈ N such that ∀n ≥ n2 one has |tn − ℓ| < ε. We need to prove that ℓ ≤ m. Let us prove this by contradiction. Suppose ℓ > m. Denote a = ℓ − m. Take ε = a/3 in the deﬁnitions of convergence above. Then for all n ≥ max{n1(a/3), n2(a/3)} we have sn ≥ ℓ − (a/3) and tn ≤ m + (a/3), or sn − tn ≥ ℓ − (a/3) − (m + (a/3)) = ℓ − m − (2a/3) = a − (2a/3) = a/3. It follows that sn − tn > 0, which contradicts the hypothesis sn ≤ tn for all n. This contradiction proves the required statement. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 46 Note that sn < tn ⇒ sn ≤ tn. Thus, we obtain an obvious corollary: if sn and tn are two convergent sequences and sn < tn, then lim n→∞ sn ≤ lim n→∞ tn. It is important to note that in this situation the strict inequality lim n→∞ sn < lim n→∞ tn may be FALSE! Consider the following example: sn = 0, tn = 1/n for all n ∈ N. Then sn < tn for all n, yet the limits of sn and tn coincide (and equal to 0). To summarize: One can pass to the limit in inequalities, but < must be replaced by ≤ and > by ≥. 8.4 The algebra of limits: further results Theorem 8.5. Let sn → ∞ or sn → −∞ as n → ∞ and sn ̸= 0 for all n. Then 1/sn → 0 as n → ∞. The proof is an exercise. Theorem 8.6. Let sn → ℓ > 0 and let tn → ∞ as n → ∞. Then sntn → ∞ as n → ∞. Proof. Let H > 0 be given; we need to ﬁnd n0 such that sntn > H for all n ≥ n0. We know that for all H1 > 0 there exists n1 such that tn > H1 for all n ≥ n1. We also know that there exists n2 such that sn > ℓ 2 for all n ≥ n2 (this follows by taking ε = ℓ/2 in the deﬁnition of the limit). Now take H1 = 2H/ℓ and n0 = max{n1, n2}. For all n ≥ n0, we have sn > ℓ/2 and tn > 2H/ℓ, so sntn > H, as required. Of course, there is a similar statement for −∞: if sn → ℓ > 0 and tn → −∞, then sntn → −∞ as n → ∞. Example. 1. n3 + 1 n2 + 5 = n1 + 1 n3 1 + 5 n2 → ∞ as n → ∞. 2. 10 n + n10 5n − n5 = 2 n 1 + n1010 −n 1 − n55−n → ∞ as n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 47 9 Standard sequences and rates of convergence 9.1 Standard sequences; the o symbol So far we have considered the following standard sequences that converge to zero: an → 0 as n → ∞, ∀a ∈ (−1, 1) (exponentials) n −γ → 0 as n → ∞, ∀γ > 0 (powers) 1 log n → 0 as n → ∞ (logarithms) Alternatively, we can say that we have the following standard sequences that diverge to ∞: A n → ∞ as n → ∞, ∀A > 1 (exponentials) nγ → ∞ as n → ∞, ∀γ > 0 (powers) log n → ∞ as n → ∞ (logarithms) There is a certain hierarchy in the set of sequences. For example, n2 grows faster than n, n3 grows faster than n 2, n 4 grows faster than n3, etc. Similarly, in the row 2 n, 3n, 4n, each next sequence grows faster than the previous one. Let us introduce some notation and terminology for comparing sequences: Deﬁnition 9.1. Let sn and tn be two sequences, such that tn ̸= 0 for all n. Suppose that limn→∞ sn tn = 0. Then we write sn = o(tn), n → ∞ (pronounced ‘sn is little o of tn as n → ∞’). Thus, we have n = o(n 2) and n2 = o(n 3) as n → ∞. In general, np = o(nq) as n → ∞ for any p < q. Similarly, A n = o(Bn) as n → ∞ for any 0 < A < B. In particular, sn = o(1) as n → ∞ means sn → 0 as n → ∞. How do exponentials compare to powers? 9.2 Exponentials beat powers The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 9.2 (Exponentials beat powers). For any a ∈ (0, 1) and any γ > 0 one has nγan → 0 as n → ∞. This can be alternatively stated as follows: Theorem 9.3. For any γ > 0 and any A > 1, one has nγ = o(A n) as n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 48 Indeed, n γA −n = nγ(A −1) n → 0 since 0 < A−1 < 1, and so Theorem 9.3 follows from Theorem 9.2. Before attempting the proof of Theorem 9.2, let us prepare a useful inequality: Lemma 9.4 (Bernoulli inequality). For every k ∈ N and x ≥ −1, one has (1 + x) k ≥ 1 + kx. Proof. The easiest proof is by induction. For k = 1 the inequality is clearly true (in this case it takes the form 1 + x = 1 + x). Assume the inequality holds true for some k. Then (1 + x)k+1 = (1 + x) k(1 + x) ≥ (1 + kx)(1 + x) = 1 + (k + 1)x + kx 2 ≥ 1 + (k + 1)x, and so the inequality is true with k replaced by k + 1. Thus, by induction the inequality is true for all k ∈ N. Proof of Theorem 9.2. 1. Let k = ⌈γ⌉. We have 0 ≤ nγan ≤ nkan, and so by the Sandwich Theorem it suﬃces to prove that nkan → 0 as n → ∞. 2. Write nkan = (n kan/2)an/2. Since 0 < √a < 1, we have an/2 = (√ a)n → 0 as n → ∞. By Theorem 8.3, it suﬃces to prove that the sequence n kan/2 is bounded. Let us prove this. 3. We have nka n/2 = (na n/2k) k. Thus, it suﬃces to prove that the sequence nan/2k is bounded. 4. Consider the number a−1/2k > 1. Write this number as a−1/2k = 1 + x with x > 0. Then na n/2k = n a−n/2k = n (1 + x)n . By Bernoulli’s inequality, we have (1 + x) n ≥ 1 + nx, and so n (1 + x)n ≤ n 1 + nx ≤ n nx = 1 x . This proves that na n/2k is a bounded sequence, as required. Example. One has n3(0.9) n → 0 as n → ∞. Can you compute the ﬁrst 10 terms of this sequence on your calculator? If you didn’t know that the sequence converges to zero, what conclusion would you arrive to by looking at the values of these ﬁrst 10 terms? 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 49 Using the ideas of the proof of Theorem 9.2, you can also prove Theorem 9.5. For any A > 1 and any γ > 0 one has Ann−γ → ∞, as n → ∞. The proof of this result is outlined in the exercises. 9.3 Factorials and logarithms So, An grows faster than nγ. Can anything grow faster than exponentials? In the exercises, you are asked to prove the following result. Theorem 9.6 (Factorials beat exponentials). For any A > 0, one has A n = o(n!) as n → ∞. Of course, there are many sequences that grow even faster. For example, nnn, nnnn , etc. What about slowly growing sequences? Theorem 9.7 (Powers beat logarithms). For any γ > 0, one has log n = o(nγ), n → ∞. Proof. We will use without proof the following elementary inequality: log x ≤ x, ∀x > 0. We have: 0 ≤ log n nγ = 2 γ · log n γ/2 nγ ≤ 2 γ · n γ/2 nγ = 2 γ · 1 nγ/2 . Using the Sandwich theorem, we conclude that log n/nγ → 0, as n → ∞, as required. It is easy to construct sequences that grow even more slowly than log n: for example, log log n, log log log n, etc. 9.4 The sequence a1/n Fix a > 0 and consider the sequence sn = a1/n, n ∈ N. Theorem 9.8. For any a > 0, we have a1/n → 1 as n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 50 Proof. 1. Let a > 1. Then a1/n > 1 for all n. Thus, denoting bn = a1/n − 1, we get bn > 0 for all n. By the Bernoulli inequality (Lemma 9.4), we have a = (1 + bn) n ≥ 1 + nbn. It follows that a − 1 ≥ nbn and so we have 0 < bn ≤ a − 1 n . By the Sandwich Theorem, we get that bn → 0 as n → ∞. Thus, for any a > 1 we have a1/n = 1 + bn → 1 as n → ∞, as required. 2. Let a < 1. Set γ = 1/a > 1. Then by the ﬁrst step, γ1/n → 1 as n → ∞. Applying the Algebra of Limits, we get a1/n = (1/γ)1/n = 1/γ1/n → 1 as n → ∞. 3. Finally, if a = 1, it is evident that a1/n = 1 → 1 as n → ∞. 9.5 Further examples Armed with the Algebra of Limits and the above theorems, you can conﬁdently compute a great variety of limits. The strategy is: ‹ Identify the fastest growing term in n in your expression; ‹ Divide by this term; ‹ Consider separately the limits of all the resulting terms; ‹ Apply the Algebra of Limits or related statements. Example. 1. (−1) n √n + n 2 + sin n 2n + n10 = (−1) n √n + n 2 2n 1 + (sin n)/n 2 1 + n102−n → 0, as n → ∞. 2. sn = n2 1/n + 3 n31/n + 2 = 2 1/n + 3 n 31/n + 2 n → 1 + 0 1 + 0 = 1, as n → ∞. 3. sn = 3 2n+ 1 2n + 22n 9n+2 + 4 = 3 1 2n + (4/9)n 92 + 4 · 9−n → 1 + 0 81 + 0 = 1 81, as n → ∞. 4. sn = (n2 + n3)(2 n + 3n) n23n + n32n = n33 n(1 + 1 n )(1 + ( 2 3) n) n23n(1 + n( 2 3)n) = n(1 + 1 n)(1 + ( 2 3) n) 1 + n( 2 3)n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 51 10 The O symbol Here is another deﬁnition useful in comparing sequences: Deﬁnition 10.1. Let sn and tn be sequences. Suppose that there exist C > 0 such that for all n ∈ N, one has |sn| ≤ C|tn|. Then one writes sn = O(tn) as n → ∞ (pronounced ‘sn is big O of tn as n → ∞.’) If sn = o(tn), then sn = O(tn), but the converse is false. Example. 1. n 10 + (−1)nn5 = O(n10) as n → ∞. 2. n2 n+1 = O(n) as n → ∞. 3. n n + 1 = 1 1 + 1 n = 1 + O( 1 n ) = 1 − 1 n + O( 1 n2 ) = 1 − 1 n + 1 n2 + O( 1 n3 ) as n → ∞. There is a certain “calculus” of O, o symbols. For example, it’s easy to prove the following statements: sn = O(n), rn = O(n) ⇒ sn + rn = O(n), sn = O(n), rn = o(n) ⇒ snrn = o(n 2), as n → ∞. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 52 11 Monotone Sequences 11.1 Theory Deﬁnition 11.1 (increasing, decreasing, monotone). A sequence sn is said to be: ‹ increasing, if sn+1 > sn for all n ∈ N; ‹ decreasing, if sn+1 < sn for all n ∈ N; ‹ non-decreasing, if sn+1 ≥ sn for all n ∈ N; ‹ non-increasing if sn+1 ≤ sn for all n ∈ N; ‹ monotone if it is either non-decreasing or non-increasing. Example 11.2. 1. sn = 1 n2 is decreasing; 2. sn = n−2 n is increasing; 3. sn = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · + 1 n is increasing; 4. sn = n! nn is decreasing (because sn+1 sn = ( n n+1)n < 1 for all n); 5. sn = (−1) n is not monotone; 6. sn = n/2 n is non-increasing (because sn+1 sn = n+1 2n ≤ 1 for all n). In particular, sn ≤ s1 = 1/2 for all n ∈ N. Theorem 11.3. 1) Every non-decreasing sequence which is bounded above is convergent. Moreover, the limit of the sequence is the supremum of its terms. 2) Every non-increasing sequence which is bounded below is convergent. Moreover, the limit of the sequence is the inﬁmum of its terms. Proof. We only prove claim 1). For the proof you must understand the deﬁnition of supre- mum. Let our sequence be sn. Since sn is bounded above, we see that the set {sn | n ∈ N} is bounded above and therefore, by the axiom of completeness, it has a supremum. Let ℓ denote this supremum. We have sn ≤ ℓ for all n. Let us prove that sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Let ε > 0 be given. Then ℓ − ε is not an upper bound for sn, so there exists n0 ∈ N such that sn0 > ℓ − ε. Since sn is non-decreasing we have sn > ℓ − ε for all n ≥ n0. Trivially sn < ℓ + ε for all n (since it is less than or equal to ℓ), hence ℓ − ε < sn < ℓ + ε for all n ≥ n0 and thus sn converges to ℓ. The proof for non-increasing sequences is similar. Write it out in full yourself! 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 53 11.2 Series A series is just a special type of sequence. Deﬁnition 11.4. Let {ak} ∞ k=1 be a sequence of real numbers. We say that the series ∑∞ k=1 ak converges if the limit lim n→∞ n∑ k=1 ak exists. This limit is called the sum of the series ∑∞ k=1 ak. So by deﬁnition, ∞∑ k=1 ak = lim n→∞ n∑ k=1 ak, if the limit exists. The sum ∑n k=1 ak appearing in the above deﬁnition is called the partial sum of the series. Series are discussed in more detail in the Analysis course. Remark. Sometimes it is more convenient to consider the series ∞∑ k=0 ak, i.e. the summation starts from 0 rather than 1. Of course, one can consider the series∑∞ k=k0 ak for any choice of integer k0, with some obvious modiﬁcations in all statements. The following two facts about series are very simple yet important: ∑∞ k=1 ak convergent =⇒ lim k→∞ ak = 0. Indeed, denoting by sn = ∑n k=1 ak the partial sum, we have an = sn − sn−1, and so if sn → ℓ as n → ∞, then also sn−1 → ℓ as n → ∞, and therefore sn − sn−1 → ℓ − ℓ = 0. lim k→∞ ak = 0 ̸=⇒ ∑∞ k=1 ak convergent. For example, the series ∑∞ k=1 1√k diverges; we will discuss this very soon. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 54 11.3 Geometric Series Let |a| < 1. Consider the series ∞∑ k=0 ak. We have an explicit formula for the partial sum: n∑ k=0 a k = 1 + a + a2 + · · · + an = 1 − an+1 1 − a . This can be easily proven by induction (or by multiplying both sides by 1 − a, expanding an comparing). Using this formula, we obtain: ∞∑ k=0 ak = lim n→∞ n∑ k=0 ak = 1 1 − a . It is clear that for |a| ≥ 1, the series ∑∞ k=0 ak diverges; indeed, in this case the k’th term of the series does not tend to zero. 11.4 Series with positive terms An important application of Theorem 11.3 is the following statement: Corollary 11.5. Let ak ≥ 0 be a sequence of non-negative real numbers. Suppose that there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all n ∈ N n∑ k=1 ak ≤ C. Then the series ∑∞ k=1 ak converges and the sum s of this series satisﬁes s ≤ C. Proof. Indeed, consider the sequence of partial sums sn = n∑ k=1 ak. Since ak ≥ 0, this sequence is non-decreasing. By assumption, it is bounded, and so it converges. Passing to the limit as n → ∞ in the inequality sn ≤ C, we obtain s ≤ C. Example 11.6. Let sn = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · + 1 n!. (11.1) 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 55 In contradistinction to geometric series, we do not have an explicit formula for sn. However, we can still prove that sn converges. Indeed, sn is non-decreasing. Now we just have to prove that sn is bounded above. For n ≥ 2 one has n! = n · (n − 1) · · · · · 2 · 1 ≥ 2 · 2 · · · · · 2| {z } n − 1 times = 2 n−1, and so sn ≤ 1 + 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 22 + 1 23 + · · · + 1 2n−1 ≤ 1 + 1 − 2 −n 1 − 2−1 ≤ 3, and so sn is bounded above by 3. Thus, the sequence sn converges. Equivalently, the series ∞∑ k=0 1 k! converges. We will say more about the sum of this series soon. Example 11.7. Suppose we have a sequence of digits d1, d2, . . . , where dk ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}. Consider the question of convergence of the series ∞∑ k=1 dk 10k . According to the deﬁnition of convergence of a series, we need to study the sequence xn = n∑ k=1 dk 10k , n ∈ N. Of course, using the common notation for decimal representation of real numbers, we have xn = 0.d1d2 . . . dn. Clearly, the sequence xn is non-decreasing and xn ≤ n∑ k=1 9 10k = 9 10 1 − 10 −n−1 1 − 10−1 ≤ 9 10 1 1 − 10−1 = 1. Thus, by Theorem 11.3 the sequence xn converges. Let us denote its limit by x. We have established that for any sequence of digits d1, d2, d3, . . . , there exists a real number x which can be represented by the inﬁnite decimal expansion x = 0.d1d2d3 . . . , i.e. by x = lim N →∞ 0.d1d2 . . . dn = ∞∑ k=1 dk 10k . 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 56 11.5 The series ∑∞ k=1 1 kp Here we consider the important series ∞∑ k=1 1 kp for various values of p > 0. We denote by sn the partial sum: sn = ∑n k=1 1 kp . Case 0 < p < 1. Let us prove that for 0 < p < 1, the series diverges. For the partial sum of the series, we have, replacing all terms by the smallest one, sn = 1 + 1 2p + 1 3p + · · · + 1 np > n np = n1−p → ∞, as n → ∞. It follows that the series diverges. Case p = 1. This is called the Harmonic Series. Let us prove that the harmonic series diverges. Let us split the harmonic series into the groups of 2, 4, 8, . . . terms: 1 2 + 1 3| {z } 2 ; 1 4 + 1 5 + 1 6 + 1 7| {z } 22 ; 1 8 + · · · + 1 15| {z } 23 ; . . . ; 1 2k + · · · + 1 2k+1 − 1| {z } 2k ; . . . Using the estimate 1 n + 1 n + 1 + · · · + 1 2n − 1 > n 1 2n = 1 2 , we see that the sum of each group above is at least 1/2. It follows that for the partial sum of the harmonic series we have: s2n = 2n ∑ k=1 1 k > n − 1 2 . So the sequence of partial sums is unbounded, hence the harmonic series diverges. Case p > 1. Let us prove that the series converges for p > 1. Again, we split our series into groups of 2, 4, 8, . . . terms: 1 2p + 1 3p | {z } 2 ; 1 4p + 1 5p + 1 6p + 1 7p | {z } 22 ; 1 8p + · · · + 1 15p | {z } 23 ; . . . ; 1 (2k)p + · · · + 1 (2k+1 − 1)p | {z } 2k ; . . . 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 57 Using the simple inequality 1 np + 1 (n + 1)p + · · · + 1 (2n − 1)p < n 1 np = n 1−p, we see that the sums of these terms can be estimated above as follows: 1 (2k)p + · · · + 1 (2k+1 − 1)p < 2 k 1 (2k)p = 2 k(1−p) = ak, where a = 2 1−p < 1. Thus, for the partial sums we have the estimate sn < a + a 2 + · · · + ak−1 < ∞∑ k=0 ak = 1 1 − a, if n ≤ 2 k − 1. So all partial sums are bounded above by a constant, and the series converges. Remark. The sum of the series considered above is called Riemann’s zeta function: ζ(p) = ∞∑ k=1 1 kp , p > 1. Although the deﬁnition of zeta function looks simple, some deepest fundamental unsolved mathematical questions are related to this function. The most famous of them is the Riemann hypothesis; the statement of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this course and is related to the zeros of ζ(p) for complex values of p. A much more “elementary” question relates to the values of ζ(p) for natural values of p. The values ζ(2n) are known explicitly (they have the form qnπ2n, where qn is an explicit rational number). However, very little is known about the values ζ(2n + 1). It is conjectured that these values are irrational, but this is only known for ζ(3). 11.6 The sequence (1 + 1 n) n and the number e Theorem 11.8. The sequence tn = (1 + 1 n ) n is increasing and bounded above, and therefore is convergent. Proof. 1. Let us prove that the sequence tn is increasing. It suﬃces to consider the ratio tn+1/tn and to prove that this ratio is greater than one for all n. We have: (1 + 1 n + 1 )n+1/ ( 1 + 1 n )n = ( 1 + 1 n + 1 )( n + 2 n + 1 )n nn (n + 1)n = ( 1 + 1 n + 1 )( n2 + 2n n2 + 2n + 1 )n = ( 1 + 1 n + 1 )(1 − 1 n2 + 2n + 1 )n. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 58 Using Bernoulli’s inequality (Lemma 9.4), we have (1 + 1 n + 1 )(1 − 1 n2 + 2n + 1 )n ≥ ( 1 + 1 n + 1 )(1 − n n2 + 2n + 1 ) > (1 + 1 n + 1 )(1 − n n2 + 2n ) = n + 2 n + 1 ( 1 − 1 n + 2 ) = n + 2 n + 1 n + 1 n + 2 = 1. Thus, we have proven that tn is increasing. 2. Let us prove that tn is bounded above. By the binomial expansion, tn = ( 1 + 1 n )n = 1 + n 1 n + n(n − 1) 2! ( 1 n )2 + n(n − 1)(n − 2) 3! ( 1 n )3 + · · · + ( 1 n )n = 2 + 1 2! (1 − 1 n ) + 1 3! (1 − 1 n ) ( 1 − 2 n ) + · · · + 1 n! ( 1 − 1 n ) ( 1 − 2 n ) . . . ( 1 − n − 1 n ) . (11.2) Estimating all the expressions in brackets from above by 1, we get tn ≤ 1 + 1 + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · + 1 n! ≤ 3. Thus, tn is bounded above. By Theorem 11.3, it follows that the sequence tn converges. The limit of this sequence is denoted by e. This is the same number e as the one that serves as a base of natural logarithms, e ≈ 2.71828: lim n→∞ ( 1 + 1 n )n = e. In fact, it is more convenient to calculate e according to a diﬀerent formula: Theorem 11.9. One has ∞∑ k=0 1 k! = e. (11.3) Proof. We use the notation sn (see (11.1)) for the partial sum of the series in the l.h.s. of (11.3). We also denote tn = (1 + 1 n ) n. We have already seen in Example 11.6 that the series in the l.h.s. of (11.3) converges. We need to prove that lim n→∞ sn = lim n→∞ tn. (11.4) 1. Recall formula (11.2). Consider the k’th term in the r.h.s.: 1 k! (1 − 1 n ) ( 1 − 2 n ) · · · ( 1 − k − 1 n ) ≤ 1 k!. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 59 It follows that tn ≤ sn for all n. Passing to the limit in this inequality as n → ∞, we get lim n→∞ tn ≤ lim n→∞ sn. (11.5) 2. Again, consider formula (11.2). Fix an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and let us keep the ﬁrst k terms in the r.h.s. of (11.2) and erase the rest of the terms. Since we have erased positive numbers, we obtain an inequality tn > 2 + 1 2! (1 − 1 n ) + 1 3! ( 1 − 1 n ) ( 1 − 2 n ) + · · · + 1 k! (1 − 1 n ) ( 1 − 2 n ) . . . (1 − k − 1 n ) . Now for ﬁxed k let us pass to the limit n → ∞ in this inequality. We get lim n→∞ tn ≥ 2 + 1 2! + · · · + 1 k! = sk. The inequality is true for all k, and so we can pass to the limit in this inequality. Bearing in mind that the l.h.s. is independent of k, we get lim n→∞ tn ≥ lim k→∞ sk = lim n→∞ sn. (11.6) Combining (11.5) and (11.6), we obtain (11.4). The last theorem gives a very eﬃcient way of computing e. Indeed, taking the sum of the terms up to 1/10!, we already obtain 7 correct digits of e after the decimal point. Example. 1. Consider the sequence tn = ( 1 + 1 2n )2n. Clearly, tn = s2n, where sn is as in the above theorem. Thus, tn is a subsequence of sn (we will discuss subsequences in more detail shortly) and therefore it converges to the same limit: tn → e as n → ∞. In the same way, one can prove that lim n→∞ ( 1 + 1 kn )kn = e (11.7) for any natural number k. In fact, k doesn’t have to be natural; one can prove that (11.7) holds true for any k ∈ R. 2. Consider the sequence rn = ( 1 + 1 n )2n. Clearly, rn = s2 n, where sn is as in the above theorem. Thus, by the Algebra of limits, rn → e 2 as n → ∞. In the same way, one can prove that lim n→∞ ( 1 + 1 n )kn = ek (11.8) for any natural number k. In fact, k doesn’t have to be natural here; one can prove that (11.8) holds true for any k ∈ R. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 60 12 Subsequences and limit points 12.1 Subsequences Deﬁnition 12.1 (subsequence). Let {sn}∞ n=1 be a sequence of real numbers and let nk be a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers (i.e. 1 ≤ n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · ). Then {snk} ∞ k=1 is called a subsequence of {sn} ∞ n=1. Example. Let sn = 1 n and nk = k2. Then snk = sk2 = 1 k2 . Theorem 12.2. Let sn be a convergent sequence with sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Then every subsequence of sn converges to ℓ. Proof. Let snk, k ∈ N, be a subsequence of the sequence sn. By induction one easily establishes that nk ≥ k for all k. Next, we know that for any ε > 0 there exists n0 ∈ N such that for all n ≥ n0 we have |sn − ℓ| ≤ ε. Now for given ε, take k0 = n0. Then for any k ≥ k0 we have nk ≥ k ≥ k0 = n0 and therefore |snk − ℓ| ≤ ε. Thus, snk → ℓ as k → ∞. Example. 1. Consider sn = (−1) n + 1 n . This sequence does not converge. Consider the subsequence snk, where nk = 2k: snk = s2k = (−1) 2k + 1 2k = 1 + 1 2k . Thus, s2k → 1 as k → ∞. 2. Consider sn = 1 10n and the subsequence snk, where nk = 3k. Then snk = s3k = 1 1000k → 0 as n → ∞. Theorem 12.3 (The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem). Every bounded sequence has a con- vergent subsequence. More precisely, if sn is a sequence of real numbers such that a ≤ sn ≤ b for all n, then there exists a subsequence of sn which converges to a limit ℓ ∈ [a, b]. Proof. If we bisect the closed interval [a, b], at least one half must contain sn for inﬁnitely many n. Call such a half [a1, b1]. Denote N1 = {n ∈ N : sn ∈ [a1, b1]}; by our choice of the interval [a1, b1], the set N1 is inﬁnite. If we now bisect [a1, b1], then, again, at least one half must contain sn for inﬁnitely many n. Call such a half [a2, b2], and let N2 be the inﬁnite set N2 = {n ∈ N : sn ∈ [a2, b2]}. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 61 We can repeat this process indeﬁnitely to obtain a sequence [ak, bk] of closed intervals with the following properties. (i) a ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ ak ≤ bk ≤ · · · ≤ b2 ≤ b1 ≤ b. (ii) bk − ak = 1 2k (b − a). (iii) For every k, the set Nk = {n ∈ N : sn ∈ [ak, bk]} is inﬁnite. From (i) we see that the sequence ak is increasing and bounded above, therefore con- vergent, say to ℓ. Likewise, the sequence bk is non-increasing and bounded below, therefore convergent, say to ℓ′. Taking limits in (ii) gives ℓ ′ − ℓ = 0, i.e., ℓ = ℓ ′. Since a ≤ ak ≤ b for all k, passing to the limit we get ℓ ∈ [a, b]. Below we choose a sequence of natural numbers nk such that snk ∈ [ak, bk] and nk+1 > nk for all k. Take n1 = min N1, n2 = min N2 \\ {1, 2, . . . , n1}, n3 = min N3 \\ {1, 2, . . . , n2}, n4 = min N4 \\ {1, 2, . . . , n3}, and so on; in general, we set nk = min Nk \\ {1, 2, . . . , nk−1}. Since each of the sets Nk is inﬁnite, we get that at each step the set Nk \\ {1, 2, . . . , nk−1} is non-empty. By construction, we get nk+1 > nk for all k. Finally, condition snk ∈ [ak, bk] holds true by the deﬁnition of the sets Nk. We now have ak ≤ snk ≤ bk for all k, and therefore by the Sandwich Theorem we must have snk convergent to ℓ. Example. Let sn = sin πn 2 . Then the subsequence snk, nk = 4k, converges to zero. 12.2 Limit points Deﬁnition 12.4. A real number a is called a limit point of a sequence sn, n ∈ N, if there exists a subsequence snk such that a = limk→∞ snk. Example. 1. Let sn = (−1)n. This sequence has two limit points: a = −1 and a = 1. 2. Let sn = sin(πn/2). This sequence has three limit points: a = −1, 0, 1. 3. Let sn = n(−1)n. This sequence has a limit point a = 0. 4. Let sn be a convergent sequence: sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Then sn has a limit point ℓ. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 62 It is clear that in the last example, there are no other limit points: Theorem 12.5. A convergent sequence has one and only one limit point; this point is the limit of the sequence. Proof. Suppose sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Clearly, ℓ is a limit point of sn: indeed, take any subsequence of sn (for example, s2n) and by Theorem 12.2 this subsequence converges to ℓ. Next, assume that there is another limit point ℓ ′ ̸= ℓ of our sequence. This means that there exists a subsequence snk such that snk → ℓ′ as k → ∞. But this contradicts the result of Theorem 12.2! In fact, for bounded sequences the converse of this theorem is true: Theorem 12.6. Let sn, n ∈ N, be a bounded sequence which has only one limit point ℓ. Then sn → ℓ as n → ∞. Note that under the assumptions of this theorem, sn has at least one limit point by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. The proof of Theorem 12.6 is a (challenging) exercise. Note that the assumption of boundedness in the hypothesis of Theorem 12.6 is important. Indeed, the sequence sn = n (−1)n has only one limit point 0 but it does not converge to 0. 12.3 Cauchy Sequences As mentioned in the introductory section, the deﬁnition of convergence suﬀers from the “defect” that in order to know whether a sequence converges you need to know in advance what the limit is. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just look at the terms in the sequence and decide that there was a limit. You can! There is a penalty to pay though. We need that all pairs of sequence elements are close together for n suﬃciently large. Deﬁnition 12.7 (Cauchy sequence). The sequence sn is called a Cauchy Sequence if for all ε > 0 there exists a natural number n0 such that for all m, n ≥ n0 we have |sm − sn| < ε . First of all we show that if a sequence is convergent then it is a Cauchy sequence. (That is, being a Cauchy sequence is a necessary condition for convergence.) Theorem 12.8. Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Proof. Let sn be convergent with limit ℓ, and let ε > 0 be given. Then there exists n0 such that |sn − ℓ| < 1 2ε for all n ≥ n0. Now |sm − sn| = |sm − ℓ + ℓ − sn| ≤ |sm − ℓ| + |ℓ − sn| = |sm − ℓ| + |sn − ℓ|. So, if m, n ≥ n0, we have |sm − ℓ| < 1 2ε, |sn − ℓ| < 1 2ε and hence |sm − sn| < ε as required. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 63 Next we see what properties Cauchy sequences possess. Theorem 12.9. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. Proof. (Similar to the proof of Theorem 7.6.) Let sn be a Cauchy sequence. We take a concrete value of ε, for simplicity 1 say, then there exists a natural number n0 such that |sm − sn| ≤ 1 for all m, n ≥ n0 . Hence (ﬁxing m = n0) we have |sn − sn0| ≤ 1 for all n ≥ n0 , and so (writing |sn| = |sn − sn0 + sn0| ≤ |sn − sn0| + |sn0|) |sn| ≤ |sn0| + 1 for all n ≥ n0 . This bounds sn from n0 onwards. Before this there are just a ﬁnite number of terms and so they have a maximum and a minimum. More precisely |sn| ≤ max{|s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sn0−1|} for all n < n0 . Combining these two inequalities we have |sn| ≤ max{|sn0| + 1, |s1|, |s2|, . . . , |sn0−1|} for all n , showing that sn is bounded. We now prove the converse of Theorem 12.8. Theorem 12.10 (Cauchy’s Convergence Criterion). Every Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence. Proof. Let sn be a Cauchy sequence. By Theorem 12.9, the sequence sn is bounded and hence, by the The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, there exists a convergent subsequence snk of sn. Denote by ℓ the limit of snk. Let us prove that the whole sequence sn also converges to this limit (NB: this is not automatic: cf. example sn = (−1) n + 1 n above). Given ε > 0, we need to ﬁnd n0 such that |sn − ℓ| < ε, ∀n ≥ n0. (12.1) As snk → ℓ, we can ﬁnd n1 such that |snk − ℓ| < ε 2, ∀k ≥ n1. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 64 As sn is a Cauchy sequence, we can ﬁnd n2 such that |sm − sn| < ε 2 ∀m, n ≥ n2. Now take n0 = max{n1, n2}. Then, for any n ≥ n0, choose k ≥ n0 and write (noting that nk ≥ k ≥ n2): |sn − ℓ| ≤ |sn − snk| + |snk − ℓ| < ε 2 + ε 2 = ε. This proves (12.1). This last theorem tells us that being a Cauchy sequence is a suﬃcient condition for convergence. Thus, combining Theorems 12.8 and 12.10, we see that a sequence of real numbers is a Cauchy sequence if and only if it is convergent. This means that for real numbers, the two conditions are identical! Warning It is not good enough for us to try to make Cauchy’s condition more manageable by making it “for all ε > 0 there exists a natural number n0 such that |sn+1 − sn| < ε for all n ≥ n0” for instance. The example √ n shows why not: in this case the diﬀerence between successive terms vanishes, but the sequence diverges. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 65 13 Absolute and conditional convergence of series 13.1 Absolute convergence The behaviour of series whose terms are positive is fairly straightforward to analyse as the sequence of partial sums is an increasing sequence. The series either increases to a limit or diverges to +∞. Life is not always that easy! The terms in a series will be of a mixture of positive and negative values in general. We can associate with any (real or complex) series an associated series, namely that made up of the absolute values of the terms. Maybe the behaviour of this new “nice” series will tell us something about the original. Deﬁnition 13.1. The series ∑∞ k=1 ak is said to converge absolutely if the series ∑∞ k=1 |ak| is convergent. Theorem 13.2. Every absolutely convergent series is convergent. I.e., if ∑∞ k=1 |ak| con- verges then ∑∞ k=1 ak converges as well. Proof. Denote σn = ∑n k=1 ak and τn = ∑n k=1|ak|. We know that τn converges and we need to prove that σn converges. Let us use the Cauchy criterion and prove that σn is a Cauchy sequence. For any n > m, one has |σn − σm| = \f \f \f \f \f n∑ k=m+1 ak \f \f \f \f \f ≤ n∑ k=m+1 |ak| = |τn − τm|. As τn is a Cauchy sequence, we get that σn is also a Cauchy sequence. Example 13.3. The series ∑∞ k=1 (−1)k k! converges absolutely. This follows from Exam- ple 11.6 (see also Theorem 11.9). It is useful to combine the notion of absolute convergence of the series with another idea: that of a comparison of two series. Theorem 13.4 (The Comparison Test). Let ∑∞ k=1 bk be a convergent series of nonnegative numbers and suppose that for some constant M > 0 we have |ak| ≤ M bk for all k. Then the series ∑∞ k=1 ak is absolutely convergent. Proof. The proof is only a slight modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem 13.2. Denote σn = ∑n k=1|ak| and τn = ∑n k=1 bk. We know that τn converges and we need to prove that σn converges. Let us use the Cauchy criterion and prove that σn is a Cauchy sequence. For any n > m, one has |σn − σm| = n∑ k=m+1 |ak| ≤ M n∑ k=m+1 bk = M |τn − τm|. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 66 As τn is a Cauchy sequence, we get that σn is also a Cauchy sequence. Example 13.5. 1. The series ∑∞ k=1 sin(k) 2k converges absolutely; this can be seen by comparison with∑∞ k=1 1 2k . 2. The series ∑∞ k=0 (−1)k k! converges absolutely (in fact, the sum of this series equals e −1). The convergence can be seen by comparison with ∑∞ k=0 1 k! . 3. We have mentioned the deﬁnition of the Weierstrass’ function (2.1): g(x) = ∞∑ k=0 ak cos(bkπx), x ∈ R. By comparison with the geometric series ∑∞ k=0 ak, we see that the series is absolutely convergent, if 0 < a < 1. 13.2 Conditional convergence As we will see very soon, the converse of Theorem 13.2 is false: ∑∞ k=1 ak convergent ̸=⇒ ∑∞ k=1 |ak| convergent. Deﬁnition 13.6. If the series ∑∞ k=1 ak converges, but does not converge absolutely, it is said to converge conditionally. The following theorem is useful in the special case when the terms are strictly alternating in sign. Theorem 13.7 (The Alternating Series Test). Let ak be a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers such that ak → 0 as k → ∞. Then the series ∞∑ k=1(−1)k+1ak = a1 − a2 + a3 − a4 + · · · converges. Moreover, its sum lies between a1 − a2 and a1. Proof. Write sn = ∑n k=1(−1)n+1ak = a1 − a2 + a3 − a4 + · · · + (−1) n+1an. Then s2n − s2n−2 = a2n−1 − a2n ≥ 0, i.e., the sequence of even partial sums s2n is increasing. Now s2n = a1 − (a2 − a3) − (a4 − a5) − · · · − (a2n−2 − a2n−1) − a2n ≤ a1, so s2n is also bounded above. Hence, by Theorem 11.3, it converges to a sum s, say, satisfying s ≤ a1. We have s2n+1 = s2n + a2n+1 → s as n → ∞, i.e., the sequence of odd partial sums s2n+1 also converges to s. Thus sn itself converges to s. Since s2 = a1 − a2 and s2n is increasing it follows immediately that s ≥ a1 − a2. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 67 Clearly the bounds stated in the theorem can be improved upon by taking any of the partial sums. Example (The Alternating Harmonic Series). 1 − 1 2 + 1 3 − 1 4 + · · · = ∞∑ k=1 (−1) k+1 k . This series is easily seen to be convergent by the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 13.7). It is not absolutely convergent, since when we take modulus of each term we get the Harmonic Series which is divergent. It is thus conditionally convergent. Example. A more general example is given by the series ∞∑ k=1 (−1) k kp for 0 < p < 1. This series is conditionally convergent. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 68 14 The limit of a function Here we are going to relate the material of this course to that of Calculus I. Throughout this section, ∆ ⊂ R is a non-empty interval, a ∈ ∆ is a point and f : ∆ → R is a function. Deﬁnition 14.1. We write lim x→a f (x) = A, if for any ε > 0 there exists δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that for every x ∈ ∆ if |x − a| < δ, then |f (x) − A| < ε. Remark. The value of δ depends on ε; here the situation is similar to that of the deﬁnition of convergence of a sequence, where the value of N depends on ε. You have seen many examples of limits of functions in Calculus 1 course. Here are some of them again as a reminder. Example 14.2. (1) lim x→0 x2 = 0. Indeed, for a given ε > 0 let us take δ = √ ε. Then |x| < δ = √ε ⇒ |x2| ≤ ε. (2) lim x→4 √x = 2. Indeed, for a given ε > 0 let us take δ = 2ε. Then for |x − 4| < δ we have | √x − 2| = \f \f \f \f ( √x − 2)( √x + 2) √x + 2 \f \f \f \f = |x − 4| √ x + 2 ≤ |x − 4| 2 ≤ δ 2 = ε, as required. Theorem 14.3. Let f : ∆ → R be a function and a ∈ ∆. Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) The limit lim x→a f (x) exists and equals A. (ii) For any sequence {xn}∞ n=1 such that xn ∈ ∆ for all n ∈ N and xn → a as n → ∞, we have f (xn) → A as n → ∞. Proof. (i)⇒(ii): Assume that A = lim x→a f (x), and let {xn}∞ n=1 be a sequence such that xn ∈ ∆ for all n and xn → a as n → ∞. Let ε > 0 be given; we need to ﬁnd N such that for all n ≥ N we have |f (xn) − A| < ε. According to Deﬁnition 14.1, there exists δ = δ(ε) such that if x ∈ ∆, |x − a| < δ, then |f (x) − A| < ε. According to the deﬁnition of convergence of a sequence, there exists n0 = n0(δ) such that if n ≥ n0, then |xn − a| < δ. Thus, taking N (ε) = n0(δ(ε)), we get n ≥ N ⇒ |xn − a| < δ ⇒ |f (xn) − A| < ε, 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 69 as required. (ii)⇒(i): Assume to get a contradiction, that there exists ε > 0 such that for any δ > 0 there exists x ∈ ∆, |x − a| < δ, but |f (x) − A| ≥ ε. Consider the sequence δ = 1 n , n ∈ N. Then for each n ∈ N there exists xn ∈ ∆ with the property |xn − a| < 1 n , but |f (xn) − A| ≥ ε. We obtain a sequence {xn} ∞ n=1 such that xn ∈ ∆ for all n, xn → a as n → ∞, yet f (xn) ̸→ A as n → ∞. Using this theorem, many properties of limits which we have already established for sequences, can be easily transferred into the context of functions. For example: Theorem 14.4 (The Algebra of Limits for Functions). Let f, g : ∆ → R be functions and a ∈ ∆. Assume that the limits A = lim x→a f (x), B = lim x→a g(x) exist. Then: (i) lim x→a (f (x) ± g(x)) = A ± B; (ii) lim x→a f (x)g(x) = AB; (iii) If B ̸= 0 and g(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈ ∆, then lim x→a f (x)/g(x) = A/B. Proof. Let {xn}∞ n=1 be a sequence such that xn ∈ ∆ for all n and xn → a as n → ∞. Then, by Theorem 14.3, f (xn) → A and g(xn) → B as n → ∞. By Theorem 8.1 (the Algebra of Limits), we obtain f (xn) ± g(xn) → A ± B f (xn)g(xn) → AB f (xn)/g(xn) → A/B (provided the denominators don’t vanish) as n → ∞. Applying Theorem 14.3 again, we obtain the required statements. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 70 15 Finite, countable and uncountable sets Deﬁnition 15.1. A non-empty set A is said to be ﬁnite if for some n ∈ N there exists a bijection between A and the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. More generally, one makes the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 15.2. Two sets A and B are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection f : A → B. For ﬁnite sets, cardinality is the same as the number of elements. For two sets A and B, let us write A ∼ B if A and B have the same cardinality. Then ∼ is an equivalence relation: ‹ For any set A, we have A ∼ A (∼ is reﬂexive); ‹ For any sets A and B, we have A ∼ B if and only if B ∼ A (∼ is symmetric); ‹ For any sets A, B, C, if A ∼ B and B ∼ C, then A ∼ C (∼ is transitive). Deﬁnition 15.3. A set A is said to be countable if it has the same cardinality as N. An inﬁnite set that is not countable is called uncountable. Example 15.4. Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . . } is countable. Z is countable. It is not diﬃcult to see that any subset of a countable set is either ﬁnite or countable. Theorem 15.5. A union of ﬁnitely many countable sets is countable. Proof. Using induction, one reduces the statement to the case of the union of two countable sets. Let A = {a1, a2, . . . } and B = {b1, b2, . . . } be countable sets. The elements of A ∪ B can be listed as a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, . . . This establishes a bijection f : N → A ∪ B. If the intersection A ∩ B is non-empty, then the above proof needs to be corrected slightly, as the map f will not be a bijection (only a surjection). This problem is not diﬃcult to ﬁx. Theorem 15.6. A countable union of countable sets is countable. 4CCM115A Sequences and Series 71 Proof. Let An be countable sets, where n ∈ N. Let An = {a(n) 1 , a (n) 2 , a (n) 3 , . . . }. The elements of A = ∪ ∞ n=1An can be listed as a(1) 1 , a (1) 2 , a (2) 1 , a (1) 3 , a (2) 2 , a (3) 1 , a (1) 4 , . . . (plot a diagram). This establishes a bijection f : N → A. Again, if the sets An are not disjoint, the above proof needs to be adjusted a little. Example. The set Q is countable, as Q = ∞⋃ n=1 1 n Z. Theorem 15.7. For any non-empty set X, the set of all subsets of X (usually denoted by 2 X) cannot have the same cardinality as X. Proof. Assume f : X → 2 X is a bijection. Consider S = {x ∈ X | x /∈ f (x)} ⊂ X. Let s ∈ X be such that f (s) = S. Is s ∈ S? Both answers (yes and no) lead to a contradiction. Corollary 15.8. The set R is uncountable. Proof. It suﬃces to show that the interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Let us prove this by contradiction: assume that (0, 1) is countable. It is easy to see that the interval (0, 1) has the same cardinality as 2N. Indeed, any real number from this interval can be written down uniquely in the form of a binary expansion 0.a1a2a3 . . . where aj ∈ {0, 1}. Such a binary expansion uniquely deﬁnes a subset of N. This establishes a bijection between (0, 1) and 2 N. Thus, we obtain a bijection between N and 2N, which contradicts the previous result.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
