Here k is ‘dummy variable’ (so you can replace it with your favourite letter instead). Problem 1 Let n ≥ 2 be an integer and deﬁne the sum S = n∑ j=1 (3j + 1)2. Which of the following expressions are equal to S ? (A) n−1∑ j=0 9j2 (B) n−1∑ j=0 (3j + 4) 2 (C) n+1∑ j=2 (3j − 2) 2 (D) 3n(3n + 2) + n−1∑ j=0 (3j + 1) 2 Problem 2 Show that n∑ j=0 n∑ k=0(j + 2k + 3) = 3(n + 1) n+1∑ k=0 k. Hence ﬁnd a formula in terms of n for the left hand side. 1 4CCM113A Autumn 2023 Which of the following expressions is equal to n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 jk ?
