Its main concern is the analysis of real valued functions of one real variable and the limiting processes underlying this analysis. Since analysis is one of the cornerstones of twentieth-century mathematics, the element of 'proof is of fundamental importance. A proof of a theorem is a carefully reasoned argument that validates the stated theorem relative to a set of basic assumptions. The basic assumptions in analysis are the axioms of the system of real num- bers. These form the substance of Chapter 2, and subsequent chapters develop the limiting processes necessary to discuss the convergence of sequences and series, and ultimately to define the notion of a continuous function. Once these fundamental ideas are in place, the twin concepts of differentiation and integration arc covered. This second edition draws on the suggestions of many users of the first edition. My thanks go to them, and I trust that they will be pleased to sec the new features of this edition, one which now deals exclusively with single-variable functions. There h. a new Chapter l, containing prelimin- ary material on logic, methods of proof, sets and functions, and the material on sequences and series has been expanded and divided into two separate chapters. In addition, there are many improvements in exposi- tion, including in each chapter a brief introductory overview. Another new feature is a prologue entitled 'What is analysis?', which sets mathe- matical analysis in its historical context. This is meant not only to prm:ide the reader with increased motivation but also to highlight the fact that in mathematics the orr.ler of presentation of topics rarely follows the original chronological development. Also included in the text are brief bio- y vi PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION graphicai sketches of some of the many mathematicians who have con- tributed to the subject. The aim throughout is to convey the fundamental concepts of analysis in as painless a manner as possible. The key definitions arc well moti- vated, and proofs of central results are written in a sympathetic style to demonstrate clearly how the definitions are used to develop the theory. Important definitions and results are prominently displayed and the main theorems are given meaningful names. The import of each definition and the content of each theorem are further reinforced by examples. Many straightforward worked examples are included, and each section of each chapter ends with a short set of exercises designed to test the reader's grasp of the concepts involved and to provide some practice in the con· struction of proofs. These exercises again reinforce the main subject mat- ter, and full solutions arc included at the end of the book. In addition, each chapter ends with a set of problems designed for class use. Where appropriate, answers to these problems are given at the end of the book. Prerequisites are a working knowledge of the techniques of calculus and a familiarity with elementary functions. The latter are used to moti- vate and illustrate the theoretical results, although the logical develop· menl of the theory is independent of their particular properties. The rigorous definitions of these elementary functions are given at the end of Section 4.3 and their analytic properties are derived in the Appendix. An informal flavour is maintained throughout, but with due attention to the rigour required in mathematics, with the overall aim of putting the read- er's previous knowledge of calculus in its proper context. Mathematical analysis courses often have a rather negative impact on students, and I hope that this book will encourage its readers to tackle with confidence more advanced texts in the subject. I should like to thank past mathematics students at Oxford Polytech- nic who have suffered earlier versions of this material and whose positive reaction to its style of presentation encouraged me to VITite this book. My thanks also go to the reviewers of draft material for both editions who provided many helpful comments, and to the staff at Addison-Wesley in Wokingham for eliciting so many useful suggestions for improvement. Finally, my thanks go to my family for their unfailing support and encour- agement.

Introduction This prologue seeks to answer the question 'What is analysis?' In a sen- tence, mathematical analysist may be regarded as the study of infinite proce.sses. Historically the subject saw its genesis in the work of the eminent Swiss mathematician, Leonard Euler (1707-1783). Euler took the calculus of Newton and Leibniz and, by giving the notion of a func- tion central place, converted calculus from an essentially geometrical field of study into one where formulae and their relations were 'analysed'. The calculus itself was the greatest mathematical tool discovered in the seven- teenth century, and it proved so powerful and capable of attacking prob- lems that had been intractable in earlier times that its discovery heralded a new era in mathematics. As with many branches of mathematics, calculus developed through an interplay between problems and theories, and is best understood through its applications. Differentiation is used to describe the way in which things change, move or grow, and most problems can be reduced to a geometric model of a curve in which a tangent is required at some point of the curve. If. for example, the curve represents the path of a moving body, the tangent gives the direction of motion at any particular time. See Figure P.l(a). Other types of problem require the determination of maxi- mum and minimum values of some quantity, and this too can be reduced to a problem of tangents and hence may be solved by differential calculus. Integration was developed for finding the areas bounded by curves, called the quadrature of curves. If, for example, the curve is a graph of the velocity of a moving object, plotted against time, then the 'area under the curve' gives the total distance covered in a given time. See Figure P.I(b). The visual imagery present in Figure P .1 reflec..1s the central role played by geometric models in the historical development of differentiation and tThc word analysis comes from the Greek wurd 11nalyei11 meaning untie or unravel. 2 WHAT IS ANALYSIS~ v (a) Tangent to a curve (b) QuadraLUre FigureP.l integration. The geometric problems of tangent and quadrature were themselves separate subjects of study for centuries before the advent of calculus, and, although it was suspected that the problems were in some sense inverse to each other, they were not formally linked until the seven- teenth century. This linkage, the fundamental theorem of calculus, ap- pears in Newton's work on the calculus. As the seventeenth century unfolded, new notations were introduced that enabled the geometric notions of curve, tangent and quadrature to be superseded by the analytic notions of function, derivative and integral. More and more applications of this new analytic calculus were generated, and it might be supposed that mathematicians everywhere would have eagerly embraced the subject. However, there was much resistance to, and criticism of, calculus, principally because of its reliance on 'infinitely small quantities' or 'infinitesimals'. This was a notion that, along with the concept of infinity, had plagued mathematics from the time of Ancient Greece. The struggle to handle infinitesimals in the context of calculus so as to avoid contradictions or absurdities arising wa.<> eventually successful when, in the nineteenth century, infinitesimals were abandoned and cal- culus became based on the fundamental concept of a limit. The remainder of this prologue traces the main aspects of the history of analysis beginning with the problematic nature of infinity and infinite- simals as perceived by the Greeks. Then precalculus attempts to solve the problems of tangent and quadrature are examined, followed by a descrip- tion of the calculi of Newton and Leibniz and their inherent deficiencies. Finally, attention is paid to the way in which mathematical analysis grew out of the need to provide a satisfactory foundation for the calculus and, in turn, why mathematicians were forced to examine the foundations of analysis itself. Precakulus developments in Ancient Greece Archimedes (287-212nc) is regarded by most commentators as having anticipated the integral calculus in his treatise, The 1\"1ethod, lost for a PRECALCULUS DEVELOPMENTS IN ANCIENT GREECE l millennium, which came to light in Constantinople in 1906. In this work, Archimedes uses the rigorous approach developed hy the C'rreeks since the founding of the Pythagorean School in 550 BC. This school placed the concept of number, by which was meant whole numher, at the centre of their philosophy. In common with scientific thought at that time, the Pythagoreans also embraced the idea that all things were made up of finite indivisible elements. Other works of Archimedes, which were read- ily available to later mathematicians, contain ingenious techniques for calculating areas bounded by curves such as parabolas, and provide evi- dence of the Greeks' anticipation of the integral calculm;. The Greeks' reluctance to use any kind of infinite process is perhaps best exemplified by considering two of the famom. paradoxes of Zeno of Elea (c. 460nc). The first paradox, Achilles and the tortoise, begins with the assertion that space and time are infinitely divii-.ible. If the tortoise is at B and Achilles is at A (see Figure P.2) then Achilles can never catch the tortoise since by the time Achilles reaches H, the tortoise will be at some further point C, and by the time Achilles reaches C, the tortoise will be further ahead at D, and so on ad infinitum: the tortoise will always be ahead! The second paradox, the Arrow, adopts the alternative hypothesis that space and time are not infinitely divisible: hence there is an indi- visible smallest unit of space (a point) and of time (an instant). Zeno now asserts that an arrow must be at a given point at a given instant. Since it cannot be in two places at the same instant it cannot move in that instant and so it is at rest in that instant. But this argument applies to all instants: the arrow cannot move at all! The dilemma raised by these two para- doxes, whereby alternative hypotheses both lead to conclusions that con- tradict common sense, is one of the reasons why Euclid's Elements never invoke the infinite. The Uement.\\· appeared in the third century BC and used a single deductive system based upon a set of initial postulates, definitions and axioms to develop, in a purely geometric form, the mathematical wi~doms of previous generations. The whole of Pythagorean number theory was included, all couched in geometric terms. For example, consideration of the areas of the squares and rectangles in the dissection in Figure P.3(a) gives the well-known algebraic result (.t + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 Concepts that were not expressible_ in geometric terms were rejected, as were methods of proof that did not conform to the strict deductive A H FigurcP.l c L> E 4 WHAT IS ANALYStsr J ,I I 1---L-- l (h) Irrational magnitudes --~~--~to--ot--~---.. x y FigureP.3 requirements of the Elements. This manic adherence to all things geo- metric was due to the fact that geometry could accommodate irrational magnitudes as well as the whole numbers and ratios of whole numbers (fractions) that formed the substance of Pythagorean mathematics. Irra- tionals such as \\/2, \\/3, Vs and so on cannot be expressed as fractions but can be represented geometrically as indicated in Figure P.3(b). The Greek approach to the problem of quadrature was thus geometric in origin. Any rectilinear figure was reduced by geometric transforma- tions to a square of the same area. In the sequence of diagrams in Figure P .4 a triangle is transformed into a square with the same area by a succession of geometric constru<..1.ions involving parallel lines, congruent uiangles, perpendiculars and properties of the circJe. For figures bounded by curves this approach runs into difficulties, but the genius of Archi- medes succeeded in obtaining the quadrature of several curves. The quadrature of the parabola is one example: in Figure P.5 the area, T, of triangle ABC is four times the sum of the areas of triangles APB and c ~E A B \"' A B U H J / D r D G E AD·BG = BH2 v_1 __ v A B B K FigureP.4 PRECALCULUS DEVELOPMENTS IN WESTERN EUROPE 5 B c FigureP.S BQC. Further triangles can then be inscribed within the parabolic seg- ment with bases AP, PB, BQ and QC. and the same relativity of areas invoked. It is clear that, in modem parlance, the area K of the parabolic segment ABC is the sum of the infinite series T T T T T + 4 4- 42 -i- 43 + ... + 4n- + ... which gives~'/'. Of course, Archimedes did not use this 'infinite process\\ but instead showed that the conditions K > j T and K < ~ T both gave rise to absurd conclusions. The Greek reluctance tu contemplate the logical validity of any process implemented ad infinitum and the lack of a notion of a function meant that no generally applicable method of quadrature was developed. In addition, Greek attention was focused on relatively few curve8. This paucity of curves, allied with an unsatisfactory notion of angle (which included \"angles' between curves), also meant that there was little interest or progress in the problem of tangents. However, the properties of tangents and normals to parabolas, ellipses and hyper- bolas were known, and Archimedes succeeded in constructing tangents to spirals. The territorial conquests of the Arabs and the rise of the Roman Empire led tu the fall of the Ancient Greek civilization and cut off Greek mathematical learning from European scholars. rt was not until the tweHth century AD that clements of Greek scientific understanding began tu filter through Arab sources and fragments of Euclid's Elemems were studied. In medieval Europe there was no identifiable discipline called mathematics, although within philosophy debate raged about whether or not infinity existed and whether or not space and time were infinitely divisible. Precalculus developments in Western Europe During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Europe, mathematics was applied over a wide range of practical subjects, and interest was centred 6 WHAT IS ANAL YSISl on how to use geometry, rather than on understanding the proofs. Latin translations of the works of Euclid and Archimedes aroused much in- terest, and work began on streamlining their proof methods. In argu- ments involving repetitive processes the formal Greek arguments that avoided passage to the limit were abandoned. Although work was careful and soundly based, it remained geometric in nature, and no real attempt was made to formulate precise conditions under which limiting processes could be invoked. Problems of quadrature arose in the many new practical applications of mathematics, and were solved by appealing to arguments involving infinitesimals. For instance, the astronomer Johann Kepler (1571-1630), who discovered that planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits, used infinitesimals to determine the area of an ellipse .. He regarded the circum- ference of a circle as a regular polygon with an infinite number of sides. Hence the circle is made up of an infinite number of thin triangles (see Figure P.6(a)), each of height equal to the radius r of the circle. Since the area of any triangle is half its base times its height, the area of the circle is half its circumference times its radius (that is, 7rr · r = ur 2). The defini- tion of 1T used here is that it is the ratio of the circumference C of a circle to its diameter 2r. Since all circles are similar, this makes C = 27T r, and hence the consequent formula for the area of a circle just described involves the same ratio 'IT. The area of an ellipse whose axes arc in the ratio b : a is now derived by first inscribing the ellipse in a circle of radius a. The ellipse is obtained from the circle by a geometrical transformation that shortens the vertical component of any point on the circle in the ratio b : a. Then both the drcle and the ellipse are thought of as consisting of infinitely many, infinitesimally thin vertical strips (see Figure P.6(.b)) whose areas arc, by construction, also in the ratio b : a. Hence the areas of the circle and the ellipse are in this same ratio and so the area of the ellipse x 2/a 2 +y 2/b 2 =1 is (1Ta 2)(bia) = 'ITab. However, Kepler was un- able to determine the circumference of the ellipse, a problem that turned out a century later to be yet another application of quadrature, albeit one that merely expresses the circumference as an integral; this elliptical inte- gral cannot, however, be evaluated in closed form. (a) Area = r.:u2 (b) Area '- trab FigureP.6 PRECALCULUS DEVELOPMENTS IN WESTERN EUROPE 7 From the time of Kepler, powerful methods were developed, pri- marily by Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647), for calculating areas and volumes. Central to Cavalieri's methods is the notion that a planar area is composed of an infinite number of parallel chords, and that a solid is composed of an infinite number of parallel sections. By sliding these 'indivisibles' along their axes, new areas and volumes are formed that have the same area or volume as the originals. Although opposition to these new methods was widespread, numerous mathematicians used them and were able to produce results equivalent to the modem-day integra- tion of expressions such as xn, sin x and so on. ~ew tangent methods also appeared in the seventeenth century, con- siderably aided by the introduction into geometry of the developing lan- guage and symbolism of algebra. Foremost among the proponents of these techniques, which relied on the use of infinitesimals, was Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). For instance, to determine a maximum or minimum value of an expression, suppose, using modern notation, that f(x) attains an extreme value at x. If e is very small then f(x - e) is approximately equal to f(x.), and so, tentatively, set f(x - e) equal to f(x), simplify and then set e equal to zero to determine those x for which f(x) is a maxi- mum or a minimum. As an illustration. let f(x)=x 2 -3x, so that f(x - e) = (x - e) 2 - 3(x - e). Then x 2 - 3x = (x - e) 2 - 3(x - e) leading to 0 = -2xe - e 2 + 3e which simplifies to 2x=e+3 P . 0 . ~ uttmg e - gives x = z· Fermat used similar techniques to find the tangent at a point on a curve whose equation is given in Cartesian coordinates. His methods are equivalent to the modern use of differential calculus, although his use of the infinitesimal e is clearly open to logical objections. By the middle of the seventeenth century, quadrature and tangent methods had advanced and been applied to a wide variety of curves. Infinitesimals and indivisibles were accepted and the idea of a limit had been conceived. In addition, the problem of finding the length of a curve had been shown to be equivalent to finding the quadrature of a related curve, whose Cartesian equation involved tangents: if y = f(x). the arc lengths between two points (xi. y i) and (x 2, y 2 ) on the curve is given by J r, I (d )2 s = - \\/ 1 + --1 dx X: I dX 8 WHAT IS ANALYSIS~ A link had been established between quadrature and tangents, and it was recognized that the problems were inversely related. What was missing was a satisfactory symbolism and a set of formal analytic rules for finding tangents and quadrature, and, more importantly, a consistent and rigor- ous redevelopment of the fundamental concepts involved. The former was soon to be furnished with the independent discoveries by Newton and Leibniz of the differential and integral calculus. The discovery of calculus Although the emergence of differential and integral calculus neither started nor finished at any particular time, it was during the second haH of the seventeenth century, owing to the efforts of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), that a unified range of processes and an effective notation were invented that came to be known as the calculus. Both men owed much to their predecessors, and recent researches show that they had relatively little influence on each other during the periods of their crucial and independent inventions. Newton learnt mathematics by studying books, including the works of Euclid, and by receiving instruction from some of the fmest mathemati- dans of the period. By the end of 1664, he was at the frontiers of mathe- matical knowledge and began his own investigations. Most of his major discoveries were made in the period 1665-1666, while the plague raged in England; these included the general binomial theorem, the calculus, the law of gravitation and the nature of colours. The history of Newton's discovery of the general binomial series is a strange one; one that led him to develop his 'method of infinite series', an indispensable tool in his approach to problems of quadrature. At that time the quadrature of curves with equation y = (1 - x 2)n was knmvn for positive integral values of n: for n = 0, 1, 2, and 3 these were x, x - ~x3, x - ~x3 + !x 5 , x - ix3 + ~x5 - 'x 7 respectively. In order to find the quadrature of a (semi)circle with equation y = (1 - x 2) 112, and, more generally, the qua- drature of curves with equation y = (1 - x 2)n when n wa~ any fraction, positive or negative, Nev.1on looked for patterns in the coefficients of x, x 3 , x 5 , x 7 and so on in the quadrature formulae then known. In so doing, he arrived at the infinite expression for the quadrature of y = (1 - x 2 ) 1/2 . He then noted that this could be obtained directly if (1 - x2)1/2 = 1 - ~x2 - lx4 - lc;xB + ... THE DISCOVERY OF CALCULUS 9 Similar series could be generated for (1 - x 1 )n for any value of n. It soon became clear to Newton that he could operate with infinite series in much the same way that the algebraists of the day dealt with finite polynomial expressions. In fact hc wrote in his work, De Analysi per Aequationes numero terminorum infinitlts (completed in 1669 and published in 1711) A!1d whatever the common Analysis [that is, algebra} performs by Means of Equations of a finite number of Terms ... this new method can always perform the same by Means of infinite Equations. So that I have not made any Question of giving this the Name of Analysis likewise. It was from this time onwards that infinite processes became accepted as legitimate in mathematics. The De Analysi also contains the first account of Newton's principal mathematical discovery - the calculus. Newton regarded a curve as generated by the motion of a point whose coordinates x and y were changing quantities that he called fluents. The rate at which these fluents change were called the fluxions and were denoted by .i: and y (d.x/dr and dy/dt in modern notation, where t is time). If o denotes an infinitely small amount of time then, during that time, a fluent such as x changes by an infinitely small amount, namely io, which Newton called the moment of the fluent. The ratio }'/x gives the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point. For example, if y 2 = x 3 then (y + yo) 2 = (x + io) 3 Expanding both sides, removing common terms, dividing through by o, and disregarding terms still containing o gives Hence . 3 2 '] 2 L-~-~-~x1/2 i - 2y - 2x 3•12 - 2 So, given a relation amongst fluents (that is, an equation relating vari- ables), Newton could find a corresponding relation between tluxions. This is of course just differentiation. Conversely, given a relation amongst fluxions, the process of finding the original relation amongst the fluents corresponds to integration, the reverse process to differentiation. The De Analysi also contains, for the first time, the use of integration to solve problems of quadrature. Newton twice. rewrote his original account of calculus in an attempt to circumvent its dependence on the use of infinitesimals, and he very nearly hit upon the use of limits. However, the mysterious moments remained, 10 WHAT IS ANALYSIS? and, although Kewton's calculus was extensively applied, its theoretical foundations remained a subject of intense debate throughout the eight- eenth century. Leibniz' early interests in mathematics ccncred around a desire to generate a general symbolic language into which all processes of reason- ing and argument could be translated. He was also fascinated by calcula- ting aids and invented, in 1671, a machine that could carry out multipli- cation. After visiting London in 1673 and meeting several eminent En- glish scientists, he began studying mathematics in earnest. His early inves- tigations were concerned with the summation of infinite sequences whose terms could be expressed as differences. For example, to find the sum of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, .. ., ~ n( 11 + l ), ... , Leibniz observed that 2 2 2 ----=----- n(n + 1) n fl+ 1 Hence 1 1 1 1 2 - + - + -: + --· + . . . + . 1 3 6 10 n(n + 1) = (~ + ~) + (i- j) + (j - ~) + (~ - ~) + · · · ~ ( ~ ~ n ! 1 ) =2--2- n+ 1 and so the sum to infinity is 2. Leibniz gained great facility in summing infinite series, and came to appreciate that the processes of summing and differencing were im1ersely related. He observed that the determination of the tangent to a curve depended on the ratio of the differences in the coordinates of nearby points, and that quadratures depended on the sums of the heights of infinitely thin rectangles. Leibniz then saw the possibility of a calculus of infinitely small differences and sums of sequences of heights that could solve the problems of tangent and quadrature for a given curve. Taking differences would correspond to finding tangents, and summation of se- quences would correspond to the determination of quadratures, and these operations would he inverse to each other. His initial work in this area centred on generalizing the work of previous mathematicians whereby curves whose quadrature was required were transformed into curves of identical quadrature whose quadrature was known. This 'transmutation' of areas involved the use of an infinitesimal triangle, a device that was to loom large in his development of differential calculus. Lcibnizian calculus took shape in the period 1673-1676, although publication was delayed THE DISCOVERY OF CALCULUS 11 until 1684 since Leibniz was aware of the furore his indiscriminate use of infinitesimals would cause. Leibniz regarded the differential dx of a variable x to be an infinitely small difference between two succci;.sivc values of x. The ratio of the differentials d y and dx of two variables y and x was taken to be finite and to represent the slope of the tangent of the curve whose Cartesian equation related x and y. See Figure P.7(a). However, relative to finite quantities, differentials were negligible and were ignored (in other words, x + dx = x). Similarly, products of differentials were negligible relative to differentials (hence a dx + d y dx = u dx ). If y and x are related by an equation then the ratio of dy to dx can be obtained by taking the differ- ential of the equation. In so doing, one has to follow the rules of calculus, examples of which arc da = 0 for a constant a, d(u + 1;) = du+ d1J and d(ur1) = u d1J + 1J du. Leibniz derived these and other rules using the gen- eral properties of differentials enunciated above; for example, to find the differential of tw, proceed as follows: d(uv) = (u + du)(v +do) - uv = udo + iidu + dudu = udv + udu It is a credit to the succinct notation introduced by Leibniz that his calculus is so easy to apply. For instance, given the hyperbola with equa- tion xy - k = 0, take differentials to obtain d(xy - k) = dO = 0 Apply the rules to get 0 = d(xy - k) = d(xy) - dk = x dy + y dx - 0 y x (a) The differential LTianglc (b) Definite integration FigureP.7 12 WHAT IS ANALYSIS~ Hence xdy + ydx = 0 leading to as the formula for determining the slope of the tangent. Leibniz' notation for integration, J, has also stood the test of time. From Figure P.7(b), the quadrature of the curve y(x), v.Titten as Jy dx, is the sum of infinitely many, infinitesimally small rectangular areas y dx. Now the differential of the area OCB is the difference. of two successive values of area, and this is none other than the area y dx of the furthest right-hand rectangle. Hence d(f y dx) = y dx, establishing the inverse relation of d and J. Leibniz was well aware that he bad not precisely defined what dif- ferentials were, nor furnished any proof that they could be discarded relative to finite quantities. As did Newton, he made strenuous efforts to remedy these foundational flaws but failed to do so. The i;ituation was not helped by the bitter controversy that surrounded the claims and counter- claims of the followers of Newton and Leibniz about who first discovered the calculus. The contributions made by both men were, and still are, impressive. Both had developed methods with wide applicability, and both, Leibni:t more so than Newton, had developed notation and symbols by which their methods could be applied analytically - that is, by means of formulae instead of by verbal descriptions and geometrical argument<>. Also they had established clearly the inverse linkage between differenti· ation and integration. Both calculi were to undergo fundamental changes before they came to resemble modern calculus; variables and relations between them were to be superseded by the function concept, mnmcnts and differentials were to be swept aside, and, through the concept of a limit, be replaced by derivatives of functions. From calculus to analysis Leibnizian calculus spread rapidly in Europe owing initially to the efforts of two Swiss brothers, Jaques Bernoulli (1654-1705) and Jean Bernoulli (1667-1748). A pupil of the latter, the Marquis de L'Hopital, published the first textbook on calculus in 1696; this well-written text dominated most of the eighteenth-century developments in, and applications of, cal- culus. Leibniz, I ,'Hopital and the Bcrnuullis took it as self-evident that two quantiHes differing by an infinitely small amount were equal and FROM CALCULUS TO ANALYSIS 13 simultaneously that infinitely small quantititcs were not zero: these infin· itely small quantities were the differentials of Leibniz' calculus and the moments of Newton's calculus. This inevitably gave rise to foundational questions such as 'Do infinitely small quantities exist?' and 'Is the use of such quantities in calculus reliable'?' One of the most famous attacks on the foundations of calculus came from Bishop George Berkeley, who in 1734 published a vitriolic tract aimed at 'infidel mathematicians'. In this tract infinitesimals were discredited and rejected as 'ghosts of departed quantities'. Despite all the criticisms, the second half of the eighteenth century witnessed an explosive growth in the use of infinite processes, justified largely on the grounds that they worked. Calculus, initially a geometric field of study, developed into the sub- ject we now call analysis owing to the epoch-making work of Leonard Euler (17{fl-1783). Euler's seminal work, lntroductio in analysin infini- torum {1748) gives central place to the concept of a function. A function of a variable quantity is defined as an analytic expression, composed in whatever way, of that variable quantity and of numbers and of constant quantities. What was important about this com.:cpt of a function was that for the first time the idea of one quantity changing relative to another was established. This notion, allied with the concept of a limit, which emerged later in the eighteenth century, was to revolutionize the calculus and lead to the establishment of finn foundations for the subject. Euler contri- buted prolifically to virtually every branch of pure and applied mathemat- ics, and is responsible for much of the notation in use today. His collected works run to 75 volumes and, although he warned against the risks in- volved in using infinite '5cries, in the lntroductio he uses infinite series in a remarkably unrestrained manner, and absurdities do arise. For example, the binomial series (1. - x)- 1 = 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + ... is used for values of x ,~ 1, and the series x 2 '\\ -.1-- = x + x + X\" + ... -x and ,'( 1 1 -·- = I + - + - + ... x - 1 x x 2 are combined to conclude (erroneously~) that ... + J, + _.!. + 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + ... = 0 x·· x 14 WHAT IS ANALYSIS? One person who regarded Euler's infinite series manipulations with suspicion was Jean le Rond d'Alembert (1717-1783); he also objected to the use of infinitesimals in calculus. He was one of several mathemati- cians who responded to Berkeley's attack on calculus by advocating the use of limits. D' Alembert stressed that in differential calculus one was interested in the limiting value of ratios of finite differences of inter- related variable quantities rather than Leibniz' ratio of differentials. Ile regarded an infinitesimal as a non-zero quantity whose 'limiting value' was zero, and he also defined indefinitely large quantities in terms of limits. But his limit concept lacked clarity, and continental mathemati- cians continued to use the language and methods of Leibniz and Euler. Even so, the increasing number of absurd deductions that could be made from the indiscriminate use of infinite processes gave renewed impetus to efforts to resolve the foundational crisis in calculus. In England attempts to introduce rigour into Newton's calculus sought to tic the calculus more strongly to Euclid's geometry or to the physical notion of velocity. The first really serious effort to give rigour to calculus was published in 1797 by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813). His influential work, Theorie des fo11ctions analytiques contenant /es principes du calculi differenriel, devel- oped calculus as a 'theory of functions of a real variable' in which func- tions possessed derivatives as opposed to curves possessing tangents. Un- fortunately, as was the case with the users of the new idea of functions, the work paid scant attention to matters of convergence and divergence. In particular, functions were considered to be 'well behaved' in that the variables involved were assumed to vary continuously and smoothly throughout their domains. The successful merging of the idea of limit and function as the con- cepts required to provide a sound foundation for the calculus, and as the tools necessary to handle problems of convergence and divergence ade- quately, occurred in 1821. The publication in that year of the Cours [)'Analyse de l' /~'cole Polytechnique by Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) brought about a fundamental change in attitudes in that rigour was applied to defining the basic concepts, and also to the manner in which proofs were presented. The Cauchy approach to calculus is essentially the modern approach in which differential calculus involves the definition, through a limit, of the derivative of a function, and integral calculus involved the limit of successive approximations to the area under the graph of a function. The fundamental theorem of calculus appears as a theorem in Cauchy's treatment. In addition, Cauchy uses his limit con- cept to define, for the first time, the idea of a continuous function as one whose values f(x) vary continuously with x. Cauchy took great care in defining what he meant by a limit. and, although the use of limits allowed him to dispense with infinitesimals and geometric notions in developing the calculus, there still remained some residual geometric notions as regards the behaviour of variable quantities. CONCLUSION 15 Conclusion The nineteenth century was very much a Golden Age in mathematics, a century in which more was added to the sum of mathematical knowledge than wa<\\ known at its beginning. The improved understanding of infinite processes was but one achievement in a period of intense activity that saw the introduction of new areas of mathemati(...-.; such as non-Euclidean geomet1'.ies, nmltidimensional spaces and non-commutative algebras. Analytic methods were applied to good effect in these areas, which in turn led to further developments in analysis itself. However, it became apparent that Cauchy had not reached the true foundations of analysis. In 1874, Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897) produced, counter to intuitive expect- ations, a function that was continuous but had no derivative anywhere (that is, a continuous curve with no tangent at any point). George Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) produced a func..1ion discontinuou~ at infinitely many points and yet possessing a continuous integral. It was realized that the theory of limits upon which analysis had been built relied on simple intuitive notions concerning the real numbers. A programme was advocated to give rigour to the system of real numbers itself. This arithmetization of analysis was a difficult and intricate task ultimately completed by Weicrstras.-. and his followers, thus completing a procc~ begun in 1700 to separate analysis from its geometric ba<;i~. Today, as in the presentation of mathematical analysis given in this book, all of analy- sis can he logically derived from a set of postulates (or axioms) character- izing the real number system. The process of introducing rigour into first calculus and then analy:;,is wao; a process mirrored in all branches of mathematics. This careful atten- tion to detail as regards basic concepts has in turn led to intricate general- izations of concepts such as spcH:e, dimension, convergence and integra- bility; topics covered in more advanced texts on analysis. One of the striking features of twentieth-century mathematics has been the move to greater genernlizat.ion and abstraction, and this, in turn, has thrown up the deeper foundational problems that occupy today's generation of re- search mathematic..-ians. The reader interested in the history of mathematics, whose appetite has been whetted by this brief survey of the history of calculus and the early development of analysis, is recommended lo dip into the following texts: Buyer and '.\\fe17.hach (1989).

CHAPTER ONE Preliminaries 1.1 Logic 1.2 Sets l.3 Functions 1 The main substance of analysis begins in Chapter 2. The purpose of the present chapter is to give a brief survey of prerequisite material, which the reader can safely skim through and refer back to as necessary. In Section 1.1 there is a relatively formal treatment of logic, intended to alert the reader to the basic logical ideas required in the remainder of this book. In mathematics one is concerned with statements about the mathematical objects being studied. Examples of mathematical objects are whole numbers, real numbers, sets, functions, and so on, and exam- ples of mathematical statements are as follows: (i) There are infinitely many prime numbers. (ii) The equation x 2 + 1 has a real root. (iii) If n is a positive whole number and n 2 is odd then n is odd. Interest in such statements is focused on whether they are true or false; the truth or falsity of a given statement is dem(lnstratcd by a proof. Statements (i) and (iii) above are true, whereas (ii) is false. The latter is easily proved by noting that the square of a real number cannot be negative. Statement (i) can be proved as follows: since there are prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5 and so on, list, in increasing order, the first n primes Pi. p 2, p 3 , •• • , p 11 • Now consider the number 17 18 PRELIMINARIES P = (P1P2P3 · · · Pn) + 1 Either p is a prime, or there exists a prime q < p such that q is a divisor of p. In the latter case, since p divided by any of Pl> p 2 , p3, ... , Pn leaves a remainder of 1, q must be a prime number greater than Pn· Hence there is always a prime number greater than Pn• whatever the size of n. It follows that there are infinitely many primes. Various alternative proofs of statement (iii) are given later. aearly the proof (either of the truth or of the falsity) of a mathematical statement needs to be a precise and carefully reasoned argument based on a collection of basic mathemat- ical truths concerning the objects being studied. This creates a difficulty in that, although the mathematical objects used may have been carefully defined, the English language used in mathematical statements also needs to be precise; but the use of the English language in real life is often ambiguous. However, as statement {iii) above demonstrates, it is only necessary to make precise what is meant by a few key words, such as if, and and then. The aim then of Section t .1 is to make precise the meaning of various key words, or connectives, a task achieved by the use of truth tables. In addition, truth tables are used to check whether two statements built up from the same oollection of basic statements, but using different connect- ives, are logically equivalent or not. Practice is provided in working with the statements of the form 'if P then Q', which can be interpreted as saying that if (the statement) Pis true then (the statement) Q is also true; when Pis false, no conclusion may be drawn. A great deal of mathemati- cians' effort is devoted to proving the truth or falsity of statements of this type. In Section 1.2 the concept of a set is introduced - a concept that pervades the whole of present-day mathematics. Any well-defined collec- tion of objects is a set, and in Section 1.2 various ways of combining sets to produce new sets are discussed. A link is established between the equality of different combinations of sets and the logical equivalence of related logical statements. Readers familiar with the language of sets need only browse through this section to familiarize themselves with the notation. Analysis is, in part, concerned with the study of functions from a very precise point of view, in order to establish, in a logically sound manner, the properties of such functions. The concept of a function is carefully discussed in Section 1.3, where numerous methods of combining func- tions to produce new functions are described. The history of the term function provides a good example of the mathematician's tendency to abstra<.-1 and generalize concepts. The actual word first appears, in Latin, in 1694 in Leibniz' work on calculus, where it denotes any quantity con- nected with a curve, such as its slope or the coordinates of a point on the curve. By 1718 a function was regarded as any expression made up of a I. I LOGIC 19 variable and some constants. This evolved into the idea of any equation involving variables and constants, and in Euler's lntroductio in analysin infinitorum in 1748 the functional notation f (x) first appears. By the early nineteenth century, a more general notion of function emerged, and the following formulation is due to Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859): A.variable is a symbol that represents any one of a set of numbers; if two variables x and y arc so related that whenever a value is assigned to x there is automatically as.c;igned, by some rule or correspondence, a value to y, then we say that y is a (single-valued) function of x. This definition is a very broad one, in that it docs not imply that there is necessarily any way of expressing the relationship between x and y by some kind of analytic expression, only that a function sets up a particular sort of relationship between two sets of numbers. The notion of a func- tion plays a central and unifying role in contemporary mathematics, and, as the reader will see, is of particular relevance in analysis. 1.1 Logic A sentence that can be labelled T (for true) or F (for false) is called a statement. Several statements can be combined to produce a larger com- prniite statement whose truth value depends not on1y on the truth values of the constituent statements but also on the manner in which they arc connected. This means that precise meanings have to be attached to those words that link, or join. simpler statement.<> together. Such words arc called connectives, example& of which are 'and', 'or' and 'if ... then'. Shortly, precise meanings will be given to these connectives, but first consideration is given to the process of negating a given statement. If P denotes a statement, its negation (not P) is obtained by inserting the word 'not' in the appropriate place. For example, if P denotes the (false) statement 'Glasgow is the capital of Scotland', (not P) denotes the statement 'Glasgow is not the capital of Scotland'. The statement (not P) has the opposite truth value to P. This fact can be summarized neatly in the truth table in Figure 1 . I . If P and Q arc two statements, the composite statement (P and Q) is deemed to be true provided both P and Qare true, and false otherwise. P (not P) T F F T Figurel.1 20 PRELIMINARIES The composite statement (Por Q) is true provided at least one of P and Q is true, and false otherwise. This information appears in the truth table in Figure 1.2, where four rows are required since there are four possible combinations of truth values when two simple statements are involved. Notice that the connective 'and' is used in the ordinary English lan- guage sense but that the connective 'or' is used in the inclusive sense. In other words, (Por Q) is true when either Pis true, or Q is true, or both P and Qare true. It is possible to combine a collection of statements in different ways and end up with composite statements which have the same truth value for any specified truth values of the constituent statements. In this situ- ation the composite statements are said to be logically equivalent. •• EXAMPLEl Show that the composite statements R = (not (P and (not Q))) and S =((not P) or Q) arc logically equivalent. Solution The truth tables for R and S appear in Figure 1.3. Notice the use of intermediary columns in building up the statements R and S from the statements P and Q. Inspection of these tables shows that the truth values of R and S, as given in the last column of each table, are identical. Hence R and S are logically equivalent . • Suppose that P and Q are two statements. Then the statement (P=> Q) is defined by the truth table in Figure 1.4. There are numerous English language equivalents of the statement (P => Q), such as 'P im- plies Q', 'if P then Q' and 'P is a sufficient condition for Q'. Whichever interpretation is used, the final two lines in the truth table in Figure 1.4 often cause confusion. They allow sentences such as 'x > 3 => x > O' to be counted as true for all values of x. In practice, the mathematician is p Q (Pand Q) (Por Q) T T T T T F F T F T F T F F F F Figorel.2 I.I p T T F F p T T F F Q (not Q) (P and (not Q)) T F F F T T T F F F T F Q (not P) s T F T F F F T T T F T T Figure 1.3 p Q (P => Q) ---···- T T T T F F F T T F F T J<'igure 1.4 LOGIC 21 R ----·-- T F T T interested in situations where ( P =- Q) is true. From the truth table, this means that (i) if P is true then Q must be true (lines l and 2): (ii) if Pis false then Q may be either true or false, and so no conclusion can be drawn in this case (lines 3 and 4). •• EXAMPLE2 Show that ( P \"'\"\"\"> Q) is logically equivalent to ((not Q) =(not P) ). Solution The truth table in Figure 1.5 demonstrates the required logical equivalence. The statement ((not Q) =-(not P)) is called the con- trapositive of (P =- Q). • 22 PRE UMIN ARIES p Q (not P) (not Q) (P => Q) ((not Q)=>(not P)) ---- T T F F T T T F F 'f F F F T T F T T F F T T T T FigUl'el.5 The statement {P => Q) docs not mean that the statements P and Q arc in any sense equal or equivalent; indeed, the statement (Q ~ P) is a different statement, called the converse of ( P ~ Q). However, the com- posite statement ((P=>Q)and(Q=> P)), abbreviated as (P~Q), does embody the notion that P and Q are logically equivalent. The statement ( P <=f> Q) is true either when P and Q are both true, or when they are both false. See Fihrure 1.6. The statement ( P ~ Q) can be read as 'P (is true) if and only if Q (is true)', or as · P is a necessary and sufficient condition for Q'. Many theorems in mathematics take the form (P => Q). To show that P implies Q, one usually adopts one of the following schemas: (1) The first method, which is a direct method of proof, assumes that Pis true and endeavours, by some process, to deduce that Q is true. Since (P => Q) is true whenever P is false, there is no need to con- sider the case where P is false. (2) The second method is indirect. First write down the contrapositive, ((not Q) =>(not P}), and try to prove this equivalent statement directly. In other words, assume that Q is false (that is, (not Q) is true) and deduce that Pis false (that is, (not P) is true). (3) The third commonly used method is to employ a proof by contradic- tion (also known as reductio ad absurdum). For this argument, assume that P is true and Q is false (that is, (not Q) is true) and deduce an obviously false statement. Th.is shows that the original hypothesis (Pand (not Q)) must be false. In other words, the statement (not p Q (P => Q) (Q::;. P) (P~Q) T T T T T T F F T F F T T F F F F T T T Figurel.6 I.I LOGIC 23 (Pand(notQ))) is true. But this is logically equivalent to (P~Q). See Question l(b) of Exercises 1.1. These three methods of proof are illustrated in the next example, where the unique factorization of a positive whole number into a product of its prime factors is assumed. • • EXA.\\1PLE 3 Assume that n is a positive whole number. Prove that n 2 odd-=> n odd. Solution 1 The direct method of proof Write n = p 1p2 ···Pr• where Pi. p 2 , ... , Pr are the (not neces- sarily distinct) prime factors of n (for instance, if n = 12 then n = 2·2·3). Then n 2 == PiP~ · · · p;. Assume that n 2 is odd. Then none of the p1 equals 2. Hence 2 is not a prime factor of n, and therefore n is also odd. 2 The indirect method of proof The contrapositive of the given statement is n even;:;;. n 2 even. As- sume that n is even and write n == 2m, where mis another positive whole number. Then n 2 = (2m) 2 == 4m 2 = 2(2m 2); another even number. Therefore n 2 is even, as required. 3 Proof by contradiction Assume that n 2 is odd and that n is even. Then n 2 + n is the sum of an odd and an even number. Hence n 2 + n is odd. But n 2 + n == n(n + 1) is a product of consecutive positive whole numbers. one of which must be even. Hence n 2 + n is also an even number .. This conclusion that n 2 + n is both even and odd is the desired contradiction. Therefore if n 2 is odd then n must neces- sarily be odd. • It is easy to construct a direct proof that the converse of the result in Example 3 is also true, and hence for positive whole numbers n, n 2 odd<=> n odd. In general, to prove theorems of the form ( P \"*> Q) re- quires that both (P .:> Q) and (Q--> P) be established. See, for instance, Example 1 in Section 1.2. 24 PRELIMINARIES Exercises 1.1 1.

Let n be a positive whole number. Find three different proofs (as illustrated in Example 3) of the fact that n 2 even=> n even. 1.2 SETS 25 6. Let m and n be positive whole numbers. Prove that mn 2 even= at least one of m and n is even. 1.2 Sets The statements of many theorems often involve variables drawn from some collection of objects. The technical term for a collection of objects is a set, and the objects in a set are called its elements. Sets arc usually denoted by upper-case letters; if x belongs to some set S, this is written as x E S, and if x does not belong to S, this is written as x it. S. If, in a given context, all the objects under consideration lie in a particular set, this set is called the universal set for the problem; the universal set is denoted by '.:U. A sentence involving a variable x cannot be counted as a statement, since it may be true for some values of x and false for others. If a sentence containing a variable x is true for certain values of x E :lJJ. and false for all others (in ~u), the proposition is called a predicate. Much of the discussion of the logic of statements in Section 1.1 can be extended to cope with predicates in place of statements. •• EXAMPLE 1 Let the universal set 611. be the set of real numbers (these arc discussed in detail in Chapter 2). The sentence P(x) given by '2x 2 = x' is a predicate since, for any value of x, either 2x 2 = x or else 2x 2 :#= x. The sentence Q(x) given by 'x \"'\"\"0 or x = 0.5' is also a predicate. It is straightforward now to construct a proof that P(x)~Q(x). First, 2x 2 = x => 2x 2 - x = 0 Conversely, => x(2x - 1) = 0 => x = 0 or 2x - 1 = 0 => x = 0 or x = 0.5 x = 0 or x = 0.5 = x = 0 or 2x - 1 = 0 => x (2x - 1) = 0 => 2x 2 - x = 0 => 2x 2 = x • 26 PRELIMINARIES Predicates are useful for specifying sets. The simplest method of speci- fying a set is to list its elements between braces. So, for example, A= {O, 0.5} denotes the set A containing the numbers 0 and 0.5 and no others. This device is of course impracticable for sets containing an infin- ite number of elements. This is where predicates can be used to deter- mine which elements of the universal set in question lie in the desired set, and which do not. For example, B = {x : 1 < x ~ 2} where x is a real number, uses the predicate P(x) given by '1 < x .:;; 2' to select those real numbers greater than l and less than or equal to 2 for membership of B. It can occur that the predicate used is universally false, as with the set C = {x: x 2 + 1 = 0}. Since there are no real numbers for which x 2 = -1, the set C consists of no elements at all. It is called the empty set, and is conventionally denoted by the symbol 0. Certain sets of numbers arc denoted by special symbols; these sets are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. The standard symbols denoting them are as follows: \\J = {n : n is a positive whole number}, the set of natural numbers Z = {n : n is a whole number}, the set of integers Q = { ~ : m and n arc integers and n * 0}, the set of rationals IR= {x: xis a real number}, the set ofreal numbers Hence fi\\J={l,2,3, ... }, 7L={ ... ,-2,-l,O,l,2, ... }, Q contains all fractions and~ contains all decimals. A subset of a set is a set all of whose elements belong to the original set. Thus A is a subset of B, written as A ~ B, if and only if x EA => x E B. If, as this definition allows, B contains elements that do not belong to A then A is called a proper subset of lJ. This is denoted by A C B. For the number sets listed above, f'\\J c \"1L C QC IR. To sec that the subsets are pro_ger, note that -1 E 7L but -1 t1. N, i E O! but ~ fl. lL, and \\12 E IR but V2 f IQ (for a proof of this latter statement see 2.1.1). Sets can be manipulated using standard operations. For sets A and B the union, intersection and dlfTerence, denoted respectively by AU H, An B and A - B, are defined by A U B = {x : x E A or x E B} A n B = {x: x EA and x E B} A - B = {x : x E A and x fl. B} 1.2 ACDB . . . A-B Figurel.7 SETS 27 These new sets are illustrated by the Venn diagrams in Figure 1.7, where the bounding rectangle denotes the universal set oU., of which A and B arc subsets. Jn each ca.~e the shaded area indicates the new set formed from A and B by the relevant set operation. If the universal set 61l is clear from the context, the difference oU - A is called the complement of A and is alternatively denoted by \">A or A c. As with composite logical statements, seemingly different combina- tions of sets can produce the same final set. Two sets A and B are equal, written as A = B, if they contain the same elements. Equivalently, A = B if and only if A!::: Band B !::: A. • • EXA.\\1PLE 2 ProvethatforanysetsAand H '€A U B = 'ti(A n Cf;lB) Solution ~A U B = {x : x E c€A or x E B} = {x: (not(x E A))urx e B} = {x: not((x E A)and(not(x EB)))} using the logical equivalence given in Example 1 of Section 1.1, where P and Q are replaced by the predicates x e A and x E B respectively. Hence~ A u B ='€(A n <€B). • In order to facilitate the simplification of set-theoretic expressions, the following laws can be established. Each law can be established in a similar manner to Example 2 above. 28 PRELIMINARIES 1.2.1 Laws of the algebra of sets Associative laws A U (B U C) = (A U B) U C Commutative laws AUB~BUA Identity laws AU0=A AUOlJ.=qi, Idempotent laws AUA=A Distributive laws A n (B n C) = (A n B) n c AnB=BnA AnA=A A n(B u C)=(A n B) U(A n C) AU(BnC)=(AUB)n(AUC) Complement laws A U~A =CU «soU = 0 <€r€A) =A De Morgan's laws <t(A U R) =<€An <€B An '<SA= 0 ~0 = 01! '€(~A)= A <6:(A n B) ='€A U <€8 The laws in the right-hand column are called the duals of those in the left-hand column. As a consequence, every identity involving sets, deduc- able from 1.2.1 yields another dual identity if we interchange the symbols n and U and the symbols 0 and <ll. The third complement law is self- dual, and so the same statement has been written twice. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is defined by AX B = {(x, y): x E Aandy EB} The Cartesian product of the set IR of real numbers with itself contains all ordered pairs of real numbers. The set ~ x IR is usually denoted by R.2 and is called the Cartesian plane. Diagrammatically, !R2 is represented by the familiar picture in Figure 1.8. 1.2 Y -- ------------,(x.y) 0 Figurel.8 I I I I I I I SETS 29 A predicate may be converted into a statement by substituting particu- lar values for the variables occurring in the predicate. So, for example, the predicate 'x < 1' yields a true statement for x = 0, but a false one for x = 2. Another valuable way of producing statements from predicates, which will occur frequently in this text, is to use the quantifiers 'for any' and 'there exists'. Although not adopted in the sequel, there arc abbrevi- ations for these quantifiers; V stands for 'for any', and J stands for 'there exists'. The symbol V may be expressed verbally in several alternative ways, such as 'for all' or 'for every'; the reader should be aware that in subsequent definitions the symbols ';/ and :: are suppressed by using suit- able English language equivalents. •• EXAMPLE3 Determine which of the following statements are true and which are false. The variables x and y are assumed to be dra\\\\n from the set of real numbers. (a) Vx (x 3 > x) (b) ';/x (cos2 x + sin2 x = 1) (c) 3x (3y (x + y = y)) Solution (a) This is false, as can be seen by substituting x = !- This value of x provides a counterexample to the claim that x 3 > x for all possible real values of x. (b) This is true, and is proved in Example 3 of Section 4.3. (c) This is true, since all that is required is to produce a value of x and a value of y for which x + y = y. Hence, for example, x = 0 and y = 2 will suffice. • 30 PRELIMINARIES Exercises 1.2 1.

This 1.3 FUNCTIONS JI A B Figure 1.9 definition begs the question 'what is a rule'!\" and indeed it is possible to give a more precise definition of a function in terms of subsets of A x B. However, for the purposes of this text, the informal specification above will suffice. The set A is called the domain off and the set Bis called the codomain of f. It is customary to write /:A-+ H for a function with domain A and codomain B, thus emphasizing the fact that f maps (or transforms) elements of A to uniquely determined clements of B. For each x EA the unique value in B corresponding to x is called the image of x under f, and is written as f(x). For example, the process of squaring real numbers may be described by the function /: !R--+ IR giYen by f(x) = x 2 • One of the consequences of a course in mathematical analysis is that it is then possible to give precise definitions of the rule(s) that determine the values of certain elementary functions. If, in a particular context, the domain of a function is understood, the shorthand notation x >-'> f(x) may be employed, provided that care is exercised not to confuse the function f with its value f(x) at x. In simple cases a schematic diagram may be drawn to represent a particular function. The diagram in Figure 1.9 represents the function f: A-+ B where A=- {O, 1, 2, 3}, H = {2, 3, 4, 5} and /(0) = .f(l) = 2, /(2) = 4 and /(3) = 5. For a function f: A-+ B the set of images of the elements of the domain need not give the whole of the codomain R. The set of images of elements of A is called the image off, and is denoted by f(A ). Formally, f(A) = {f(x): x EA} Tf C is a subset of A then the image of C under f is the set f( C) = {f(x): x E C}. See Figure 1.10. •• EXAMPLE l Suppose that/:~- !R is given by f(x) = l/(x 2 + 1). Show that the image off is the set {x: x E ~and 0<x~1}. 32 PRELIMINARIES A Figurel.10 Solution The image of f is /(lli) = {-1- : x e IR} x 2 +1 8 Now, for all x e R, x 2 ~ 0, and so x 2 +1;;;:,1. But then, O < 1/(x2 + 1) ~ 1 for all x e IR. The.refore f(R) ~ {x: x e iR and 0 < x ~ 1} Conversely, if 0 < y ~ 1, the equation y = 1/(x 2 + 1) admits two solutions, namely In other words, there is a real value of x with f(x) = y. Hence {x : x e Rand 0 < x E:; l} ~ f(IR) Therefore the image off is the set {x : x e R andO < x ~ 1}. • The set { x : x e IR and 0 < x ~ 1} is an example of an interval of real numbers. Given real numbers a and b, with a \"\"' b, the dosed interval [a, b] denotes the set { x : x e IR and a .;;;; x ~ b}. If one of the inequalities in the defining predicate is strict (and so one or other ·of a or b is omitted), the relevant square bracket i.s replaced by a round bracket. For example the set /(R) in Example 1 may be written as (0, lJ. When both endpoints of an interval are omitted, the open interval (a, b) denotes the set { x : x e llhnd a < x < b}. This book is concerned with functions/: A-+ IR where the domain A is a subset of A. Two functions f: A~ IR and g: A~ R are deemed to be 1.3 FUNCTIONS J] equal jf they have the same domain A and if /(x) = g(x) for all x in their common domain. If/: A--+ IR and g: A--+ R are two functions, it is possible to form the sllDI function, f 1- g, and the product function, fg; obtained respectively by adding and multiplying function values. Hence (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(.x) and (/g){x) = f(.x)g(x) for all x EA. Similarly. f- g may be formed, where (j- g)(x) = f(x) - g(x) for all .x EA. Also, if A ER, the function A.f may be formed, where (A.f)(x) = A.f(x) for all x EA. It now follows that f - K is the same function as f + (-1 )g. Finally. if g: A --+ R is a function such that g(x) is never zero, the reciprocal function 1/g may be formed by defining (1/g)(x) = 1/g(x) for all x EA. The product of this reciprocal function with any other function f: A--+~ produces the quoti- ent f/g where (f/g)(.x) = f(x)/g(x) for all x EA. More subtle ways exist of combining functions. Suppose that f: A--+ Band g: B--+ C arc functions such that the codo- main off coincides with the domain of g. For any x EA, f(x) lies in the domain of g, and so g{f(x)) may be calculated. In fact, g(f(x)) can be calculated under the weaker condition that the image of f lies in the domain of g. In either case the formula g(f(x)) is used to define the composite function g 0 f: A-+ C by the rule x I-,) g(f(x)). Sec J<igure 1.11. Composition of functions is an extremely useful way of constructing new functions from more basic ones. Properties of functions that are pre- served under sums, products, quotients, composites and so on are a key feature of courses in mathematical analysis. •• EXAMPLE2 Find the composites g o f and f c g for the functions f: R--+ R and g: R--+ R given by f(x) = x 3 and g(x) = x + 2. Solution Since f and g have domains and codomains equal to IR, both of the composites g \"f and f o g are defined. The composite g 0 f: R--+ R is given by (g 0 f)(x) = g(f(x)) = x 3 + 2, and the composite Figure J.11 34 PRELIMINARIES fog: IR- IR is given by (f o g)(x) = f(g(x)) = (x + 2) 3 • Notice that go f =1= .fog. • The last way of producing new functions from old functions is now considered; the basic idea is one of reversing the effect of the original function, and it only applies to functions with particular properties. Con- sider the function f: IR-+ R given by f(x) ,--- 3x + 2. To compute a value of this simple function, take x E IR, multiply it by three and then add two. To reverse this process, first subtral-1 two and then divide by three. See Figure l.\"12. The reason that f can he reversed is that for ariy y E iRl the equation y = 3x + 2 admits a solution for x, and this solution is unique; in fact x = 1Cv - 2). It is thus possible to define an invcrs~ function. denoted by .r-1 : IR-+~. by the rule x ~ ~(x - 2). Notice the use of x as the domain variable for both f and 1- 1• The reader should be careful not to confuse the inverse function f ·1 with the reciprocal function (1/f), which in this case is not defined! In general, inverse functions do not exist; the general criterion for an inverse function to exist is now developed. A function/: A-+ Bis injet:tive if distinct clements of A have distinct images in B. In other words, x 1 -=/= x2 :;..- /(x 1) * f(x 2). The contrapositive of this condition is more u.-.cful in practice; namely, f is injective when f(x1) = f(x2) =>x 1 = X2- A function f: A-+ B is surjedivc if every ele- ment of the codom.ain B lies in the image off (thctt is, f(A) = B). If f is both injective and surjcL1ive, it is called a bijective function. A bijective function /:A---+ B is thus characterized by the property that for every element y in the codomain of f there exists a unique element x . in the domain off such that f(x) = y. This is precisely what is required for one to be able to define the inverse funl-1ion, since the effect of f can be reversed simply by sending each element of H back to the unique element of A from whence it came. This inverse function is denoted by .r ·1 : B-i-A and it is itself hijcctive; moreover, (/- 1)- 1 = f. The reader has the opportunity to calculate inverse functions in Exercises 1.3. • • EXA.i.VIPLE 3 Determine which of the following functions is bijective: (a) f: IR-io lR given by f(x) = 3x + 2 (b) g: R-io IR given by g(x) = 1/(x 2 + 1) Solution (a) First, f is injective, since => X1 = Xz 1.3 DIVIOE ____ 3_x_ HY3 y- 2 Figure 1.12 Sl.iBTRACT 2 FUNCTIONS 35 Secondly, if y E ~ then y = 3x + 2 if and only if x = l<Y - 2). Hence for each real number y there exist., a real number x with f(x) = y. Therefore the iim1ge off coincides with the codomain of f. Thus f is bijective. (b) The function g fails to be bijective on two counti. (only one is required of course). As seen in Example I, g(R)-:= (0.1], and so the image of g is a proper subset of the codomain of g. In one sense this deficiency can be overcome by defining a (technically new) funl-1iun G: R---,i. (0, 1] by the rule G(x) = 1/(x 2 +I). The codomain of G and the image of G now coincide by design. However, G (and g) fails to be injective. To see this, ohscrve that G(l) = G(-1). At this point it is worth noting that the function h: A - B, where A = [O, oc), B = (0, 1 J and h(x) = 1/(x 2 + I), is injective and has image H coinciding with illi cndomain. Hence h is a bijective function, which, it must be emphasized, is a different function from the oribrinal function g. This is a good illustration of the fact that there is more to a function than the formula defining it! • As will be seen in later chapters, functions that can be built up from a set of basic functions by adding, subtracting. multiplying, dividing (when possible), scaling, composing (when possible) and inverting (for bijective functions only) inherit many important analytic properties of the original basic functions. It is for this reason that attention is focused both on the properties possessed by certain elementary functions such as polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and the exponential function, and on those properties inherited by the various ways of combining these basic functions.

CHAPTER TWO The Real Numbers 2.1 Numbers 2.2 Axioms for the rea1 numbers 2.3 The completeness axiom 2 During the nineteenth century, mathematicians involved in the process of producing a rigorous foundation for analysis found that their work was ba~d upon simple intuitive notions concerning the system of real num- bers. Since the analysis being developed involved the study of real func- tions. that is, functions whose domains and images arc subsets of the real line, there was a clear need to develop firm foundations for the real number !system itself. This feat wa'\\ accomplished by the turn of the nineteenth century, and is commonly referred to as the arithmeti:zation of analysis. In Section 2.1 there is heavy reliance on readers' intuitive notions regarding numbers. In particular it is assumed that numbers can be repre- sented geometrically as points on an infinite straight line where, after choosing a unit of length, the whole number~ arc used to label a set of evenly spaced points on this line. This number line is illustrated in Figure 2.]. Fractions (or, as they will be called from now on, rationals) can also be marked on this numher line; for example. ! is placed exactly halfway between the points labelled 0 and 1. This means that there is a naturaJ ordering of the rationals on the number line. For example ~ lies to the -2 -1 0 ~ F'lgure2.l 2 3 41 42 THE REAL NUMBERS left of ~ since fi = ~ and ~ = ~. This fact is expressed as 2 7 2 < ~, which is read as ·i,_ is less than ~·- ll now seems reasonable, though sadly wrong, to suppose that every point on the number line can be labelled with a rational. To sec why this intuition is wrong, consider a point to the right of the point labelled 0 whose distance L from 0 satisfies 0 < L < 1. Since there arc infinitely many. infinitely closely packed rntionals between 0 and 1, surely one of them must coincide with L? But the rationals 0, ·1. ! , !, i, k· ~. ~, ~' ft;, ... and so on, obtained by ::.ucccssive bisection, are infinitely closely packed, and they do not even account for the point labelled by the fraction ~- What is surprising i~ that even if rationals between 0 and 1 with any denominator are included, there will be un- labelled points. This i-s proved in theorem 2.1.1, where it is shown that the distance usually denoted by \\/2 does not correspond to any rational. The remainder of Section 2.1 uses familiar notions such as the decimal expansion of numbers to show that between any two poinL~ on the number line there are infinitely many points that do not correspond to rationals as well a-. infinitely many that do. The existence, at least in geometric terms. of non-rational (or irra- tional) numbers was a :source of great confusion for early mathematicians, and it wa-. only in the nineteenth century that the entire system of real numbers was successfully developed from the set N of natural numhcrs. Since this theory is fairly complicated, it is not appropriate to present it here. However, the material pre:sentcd in Section 2.1 docs use various properties of the real number system. and, although these are applied mainly to rationals, there is the tacit assumption that they hold for the entire set of real numbers. Since the real numbers are to form the starting point for the development of analysi'!., it is necessary Lo spell out prcc..;scly what properties of real numbers are being assumed. Then, as far as analysis is concerned, the whole theory can he deduced from these prop- erties, or axioms. The axioms for the real numbers form the substance of Section 2.2, and the results of Section 2.1 can all be deduced from these axioms. Of particular importance in analysis is the last of the axioms, the completeness axiom. This axiom is treated separately in Sec..1ion 2.3, where it is used to prove that between any two distinct real numbers, however close, there is a rational number. It is also used to prove that v'2 exists as a real number and hence that the set of rational numbers satisfies all of the axioms for the real numbers with the exception of the completeness axiom. Thus it is the completeness axiom that distinguish:::s between the set 0 of rational numbers and the set ~ of real numbers. 2.1 Numbers Our first encounter with numbers is with the set N of counting numbers or natural numbers. These are 1, 2, 3, ... and so on. Young children 2.1 NUMBERS 43 learn them by rote, and contact v.~th adults leads to an awareness of their significance in phrases such as 'two eyes' and 'four marbles'. The concept of 'no marbles' and hence the existence of the number zero comes later and is a little harder to assimilate. Next we learn basic arithmetic where certain truths such as a+ b = b +a and (a+ b) + c =a+ (b + c) may or may not appear obvious, depending on the methods used. For example, if additioTI is performed by 'counting on', a sum like 2 + l9 is more difficult than 19 + 2. whereas the use of the culoured rods of the appropriate lengths laid end to end makes 2 + 19 = 19 + 2 a triviality. When we learn subtraction, we find that 5 - 2 = 3 is analogous to the problem of removing two marbles from five marbles to leave three mar- bles. This is fairly easy to comprehend. However, 3 - 5 leads to negative numbers, which have to be interpreted using a model involving debts or the descent of ladders. We extend our horizons and end up with the set 'lL of integers, consisting of zero and all positive and negative whole num- bers. Arithmetic in \"11. is more complicated, and, when we come to multi- ply integers, facts like -1 times -1 equals 1 seem far from obvious. Fractions are introduced to facilitate division. To share six marbles between three people to give them two apiece is written symbolically as 6 6 + 3 = 2 or - = 2 3 Although we cannot divide 11 marbles equally between three people, we can still attach a meaning to the fraction #, thus arriving at the set Q of rational<11. Formally, O! = {: : m and n are integers and n * 0} Addition and multiplication of rationals are given by m p (mq + np) - + ··-- = -'----=----=---'- n q nq m p mp and -X-=- n q nq One quirk of this notation is that apparently different fractions define the same rational. For example, ~ - j = k is the same as ! x ~ = r1. However, every positive rational can be expressed in the form m/n where m and n arc positive integers with no common factors greater than one. The rational in question is then said to be in its 'lowest form'. The rationals can be placed on the number line as in Figure 2.1, and the question can then be posed as to whether or not every point on this number line corresponds to some rational. Put another way, is every length a rational length? The answer is no! The following result is attri- buted to Pythagoras. 44 THE REAL NUMBERS 2.1.1 Theorem There is no rational number whose square is 2. Proof First note that it is possible to construct a line segment of length x with x 2 = 2. See Figure 2.2. Suppose that x is rational. Then, as observed above, x can be expressed as a rational in its lowest form. Hence x = m/n, where m and n are integers, n =F 0 and m and n have no common factor greater than one. Now m 2 = 2n 2 , and so m 2 is an even integer. Hence mis also even (see Question 5 of Exercises 1.1) and so m = 2m 1 for some other integer m 1 • Hence m 2 = 4mr = 2n 2 , leading to n 2 = 2m~. Thus n 2 is even and so n is also even. But then m and n have a common factor of 2. This contradiction can only be resolved by concluding that x is not a rational number. D 'The proof of Theorem 2.1. l is a classic example of a proof by contra- diction (see Section 1.1). In such a proof the required result is assumed to be false, and it is shown by some means that this assumption is inconsist- ent with the given information. Since it is deemed impossible to deduce any inconsistencies from true statements, the original assumption must be wrong. In other words, the required result is in fact true. This method of proof is particularly useful when dealing with results that are phrased in a negative manner, such as Theorem 2.1.1. The theorem itself demonsLTates that there are simple equations, such a-; x 2 = 2, that have no rational solutions. In order to handle such equa- tions, it is necessary to introduce new numbers that are not rationals. So let \\/2 denote the solution of x 2 - 2, which corresponds to the le~th of the hypotenuse of the triangle in Figure 2.2. A number, such as V2, that is not rational is called irrational. Other examples of irrational numbers are \\13, \\16, 2Vs, u, e, and loge2. The question now arises as to how irrational numbers can be incorporated into arithmetic calculations. One way forward is to introduce a representation for rational numbers that can be extended to represent irrational numbers as well. Figure2.2 2.1 NUMBERS 45 Pythagoras (born 572 Be) was one of the outstanding mathemati- cians of Ancient Greece. The advent of the Greek civilization in the second millennium HC saw a growth in rationalization in all areas of human activity. Modern mathematks was born in this atmosphere - a mathematics that not only asked 'how'!' but also asked the scienti- fic. question 'why?'. !')1hagoras founded the famous Pythagorean school, an academy for the study of philosophy. mathematics and the natural sciences. Their philosophy rested on the assumption that whole numbers were the cause of the various qualities of man and matkr. Daily life required the measurement of quantities such as length. weight and time, and the rational numbers were at first deemed sufficicn~ for such practical purposes. However, the Pythagoreans showed that there is no rational number correspond- ing to the point P on the number line wh1.:rc the distance OP is equal to the diagonal of a square having unit side (see Figure 2.3). The discovery of irrational magnitudes such as \\(2 upset the underlying philosophy of the Pythagoreans that everything depended on whole numbers. For a time, efforts were made to keep the whole matter secret, though a treatment of irrational numbers is recorded in the fifth hook of Euclid's Elements. This account accords weJI with nineteenth-century European expositions. A decimal is an expression of the form ±a0 .a1a2a3 •• • , where a0 is a non-negative integer and a 1, a2 , a 3 , .• • , are digits. If only a finite number of the digits ai. a 2, a3 . .. are non-zero then the decimal is called a terminating or finite decimal, and the infinite tail of zeros is usually omitted. Such decimals represent rationals; for example, 1.63 = 1 + {ii+ 1ii0 = fM. It can he shown that any rational whose denomi- nator contains only powers of 2 and/or 5 can be represented by a termin- ating decimal, which can be found by long division. However, there arc rationals for which the process of long division yields a non-terminating or infinite decimal; for example, ~~ = 0.310610610610 ... These infinite decimals have the property that they are recurring. In other words, they have a recurring block of digits, and so may be written in 'Shorthaml form as follows: 0.31061061061 ... = 0.3106. To see why the decimal expansion of a rational number is either a terminating or recurring decimal, consider the way in which the decimal is 0 1:' Figurel.J 46 THE REAL NUMBERS generated. Consider a rational p/q lying in the interval fO, 1), so that 0 ~ p < q, and apply the method of long division. Then where a1 is a digit and r 1 is an integer satisfying o~ r 1 < q. In other words 'q goes into lOp, a 1 times with remainder r 1'. Now consider the rational ri/q, which also lies in the interval [O, l). Then where a 2 is a digit and r 2 is an integer satisfying 0 ~ r 2 < q. Continue this process for n steps, arriving at lOrn-1 = a,.q + Yn where an is a digit and r n is an integer satisfying 0 ~ r n < q. Since = (~ )10-n < 10-n this process generates the first n dec..imal digit-; in the decimal expansion O.a 1a2a3 ... an ... of p/q. At each step, the remainder r; is one of 0, 1. 2 •... , q - 1, and so after q + 1 steps the same remainder must have occurred more than once. This means that (provided zero is not one of the remainders) a recurring pattern will be established in which the block of digits which repeat is nu longer than q - 1 digits ~ length. If zcw occurs a<; a remainder then all successive decimal digits are zero and the decimal terminates. Since any rational can be written as ±a0 + p/q where a 0 is a non-negative integer and piq is a rational in the interval fO, 1), the decimal expansion of any rational number is either a terminating or a recurring decimal. Conversely, a tenninating or recurring decimal represents a rational number. This is not difficult to establish when the de'-;mal is finite. The infinite case is not so straightforward, and for a rigorous treatment re- quires knowledge of infinite series, in particular, geometric series. which are covered in Section 4.1. It is, however, relatively easy to see how the process of representing a recurring decimaj_as a rationa~orks. For in- stance, consider the recurring dcdmal 0.312. Let x = 0.12 and multiply 2.1 NUMBERS 47 both sides hy 10 2 (because the recurring block has length 2). Then lOOx = 12. 12 = 12 + x Hence 99x := 12 and so 12 4 x=-- = -- 99 33 Therefore - 3 x 3 4 103 0.312 = - +- = - +--- = 10 10 10 330 '.BO It is now natural to ask if irrational numbers can be represented hy decimals. cspcciaJ!y since it is possible to find finite decimals very close to numbers like Y2; the n:adcr may like to check that (1.414213 56) 2 docs give an answer very close to 2. The answer is yes, hut this is a conse- quence of the axiomatic description of the set of real numbers presented in the next section, and not a consequence of the material presented so far in this chapter. Under the assumption that irrational numbers can be represented by decimals, then, these decimals are neither finite nor recur- ring. It is also the case that infinite non-recurring decimals, such as 0.101001000100001 ... and 0.123 456 789101112 ... represent irrational numbers, and so the set R of real numbers can, naively, be considered as the set of all decimals. Each point of the number line in Figure 2.1 then corresponds to some decimal. The follow- ing results show that irrationals are far from rare and that they arc inti- mately mixed up with rationals on the number line. 2.1.2 Theorem ff m/n and p/q are rationals, p -t 0, then m/n + \\/2(p/q) is irrational. 48 THE REAL NUMBERS Proof The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that m/n + V2(p/q) is a rational number. Then the following can be written: m+Vz(p)=!_ n q s where m, n, p, q, r and s are all integers, and n, q and s are non-zero. Rearranging the equation gives \\/2 = q(rn - ms) pns which is a rational. This contradicts 2.1.1, and so the hypothesis that m/n + Vz(p/q) was rational is wrong. Hence m/n + '\\/2(p/q) is irrational. U 2.1.3 Theorem Between any two distinct rationals there is an irrational. Proof Suppose that m/n < p/q. This gives p/q - m/n > 0. Hence m < m + \\/2 (..!!_ _ m) n n 2 q n and, since Vz/2 < 1 , m + Vz (.!!.... _ m) < m ...;... (.!!.... _ m) = ]!_ n 2 q n n q n q Thus the irrational lies between the rationals m/n and p/q. 2.1.4 Theorem Between any two distinct irrationals there is a rational.

Thus a= ao.a1a2 ... an ian . . . and b = ao.a1a2 ..• a,,_1bn ... where a,, < b,,. Now let x = au.a 1 a2 ... an-1 bnOOOOO ... Hence x = (a0a1a2 ... b11)/l0\" is rational and a <x < b. :::J These results can be further refined to show that between any two distinct real number!; then; arc infinitely many rationals and infinitely many irrationals. The above results rely, of course, on the many assumptions about real numbers that have been made in this section. Questions such as whether irrational numbers exist have not been !.atisfactorily resolved. As men- tioned in the introduction to this chapter, the system of real numbers can be con!.tructed from the set '\\! of natural numbers. This is a complicated process that, once achieved, enables certain properties possessed by the real numbers to be proved. With care, a selection of these properties can be listed that completely characterize the set IR of real numbers. In Sec- tion 2.2 this list of properties of ~ is presented as a set of axioms, and further properties which arc required in the formal development of analy- sis arc deduced. Material in this section will only be used when it is clear that it follows from the axioms. Exercises 2.1 1.

The axioms fall under three headings: (1) the axioms of arithmetic (2) the axioms of order (3) the completeness axiom The first two groups of axioms are well-known properties from which all the usual rules for manipulating real numbers may be derived. In more advanced texts IR is constructed from something more basic, for example from the set of integers, or from set theory, and it is then necessary to prove that the numbers constructed satisfy these axioms. In this text we start from the assumption that R exist-.. We a<>.<;ume then that there arc two functions from R x IR to R. These are called addition and multiplica- tion, and the images of (a, b) under these functions arc denoted hy a+ h and a· b respectively. 2.2.1 The axioms of arithmetic Al a+(h+<:)=(a+IJ)+c A2 a+ h = h +a A3 There exists a unique element 0 in IR satisfyi~g a + 0 = a A4 For any a in IR, there exists a unique element x in R satisfying a+ x = 0 A5 a· (b • c) =(a· b) · c A6 a·b=b·a A7 There exists a unique element 1 in R, 1*0, satisfying a· I= a A8 For any a in IR, a * 0, there exists a unique clement y in IR satisfying a · y \"\" 1 A9 a· (b + c) =a· b +a· c 2.2 AXIOMS FOR THE REAL NUMBERS 51 Notes (1) Each axiom holds for aJl a, h, t· E ~- (2) Any set satisfying A1-A9 is called a field. (3) The x in A4 is called the negative of u and is usually denoted by (-a). (4-) They in A8 is called the reciprocal of a and is written as 1/a or ll- 1. (5) Axioms Al and AS allow us to omit brackets in expressions such as a+ b + c or a· b · c · d. (6) The axioms give names to only two particular clements of R, namely 0 and .1. whose roles are defined in A3 and A7. (7) 0- 1 is not defined - sec A8. In fact, no such element exists by Example l(a) below. (8) Subtradion can be defined by a - b = a + ( - b). (9) DMsion can be defined by a+ b =a· (b- 1), b =F 0. It is assumed that the reader is quite familiar with axioms Al-A9. From these axioms, many further algchraic properties can be deduced. Since these axioms are so basic, several elementary consequences are needed first. •• EXAMPLE 1 Deduce that (a) for aJl X E ~. X • 0 = 0 (h) for allx, y E IR, x · (-y) = -(x · y) Solution (a) NowO+O=Oby A3, andsox·(O+O)=x•O. Thus, byA9, x · 0 + x · 0 = x · 0. Since (x · 0) E '.R, it possesses a negative -(x · 0) by A4. Now ((x ·O) + (x ·O)) + (-(x ·0)) = (x ·O) + (-(x ·O)) and hence (x · 0) + ((x · 0) + ( -(x · 0)) = (x · 0) + (-(x · 0)) by Al So (x · 0) + 0 = 0 by A4, and finally x · 0 = 0 by A3. 52 THE REAL NUMBERS (b) Now (x·y)+x·(-y) =x·(y+(-y)) byA9 = x ·0 =0 byA4 by (a) By A4, the negative of (x · y) is the unique real number -(x·y) satisfying (x·y)+(-(x·y))=O. Hence x-(-y)= -(x. y). • The reader is invited to derive similar properties in Exercises 2.2. Of course, in practice, one would not write out detailed proofs of results like these. What is important is that the algebraic manipulations arc firmly based on those properties of numbers (the axioms of arithmetic) that form our logical starting point. In principle, all the elementary algebraic operations that are carried out routinely can be justified in detail by deducing them from the axioms. This is quite a lengthy business, as the following example shows. •• EXAMPLE2 Prove the algebraic identity (a - b) · (a+ b) = a 2 - b 2 • Solution (a - b)-(a + b) =(a + (-b)) ·(a + b) using Note (8) =(a+ (-b))·a +(a+ (-b))·b byA9 = '1-(a + (-b)) + b·(a + (-b)) by A6 = a·a + a·(-b) + b·a + b-(-b) by A9andA1 = a·a + (-(a·b)) + b·a + (-(b·b)) using Example 1 (b) =a· a+ (a· b +(-(a· b)) + (-(b · b))) by A6, A2 and Al = (a·a +O) + (-(b·b)) byA4andA1 =a·a+(-(b·b)) byA3 = a2 - b2 using Note (8) • 2.2 AXIOMS FOR THE REAL NUMBERS SJ The axioms of arithmetic alone arc not sufficient to describe IR com- pletely, f.iincc many proper subsets of IR also satisfy A 1-A9. for example Q. A relation ~ can be defined on IR such that, for certain clements, a, b E IR, a~ b. In terms of the heuristic ideas in Section 2.1, a~ b, read as ·a is less than or equal to b', occurs when a corresponds to a point on the real number line (Figure 2. 1) to the left of the point corresponding to b. It is required that this order relation~ satisfy the following axioms. 2.2.2 The axioms of order i\\10 a ~ b or b ~ a All a ~ b and ·b ~ a ==>a = b Al2 a ~ b and b ~ c => a ~ c Al3 a ~ b -=-:> a + c ~ b + c: A14 a~ band O-.s:: c =a· c ~ b · c Notes ( l) Each axiom is satisfied by any a, b, c: E IF!.

The answer is provided in the next example. •• EXAMPLE4 Prove that a ~ b and c ~ 0 =-> b · c ~a · c.

This observation follows from Question 2 of Exercises 2.2. Hence x 2 + x - 2 < 0 <=> (x - 1) < 0 and (x + 2) > 0 <--> x < 1 and x > -2 ~ -2 < x < 1 The solution tu the problem is -2 < x < 1. • 56 THE REAL NUMBERS •• EXAMPLE7 Solve the inequality Sx + 6 2x - 3 -->-- x + 2 x -1 Solution Now 5x + 6 > 2x - 3 <::> 5x + 6 _ 2x - 3 > 0 x+2 x-1 x+2 x-1 <=> (Sx + 6)(x - 1) - (2x - 3)(x + 2) > 0 (x - l)(x + 2) 3x 2 <->--- >0 (x-1)(x+2) Since x 2 ~ 0 for all x, the inequality is equivalent to (x - 1 )(x + 2) > 0. But the inequality (x - l)(x + 2) ~ 0 describes those values of x that do not satisfy the inequality in Example 6. Hence the solutjon set is x < - 2 or x > 1. • The next example establishes the triangle inequality, which finds much application in what follows. First it is necessary to jntroduce Ix J, the modulus (or absolute value) of a ieal number x: lxl = {_: if 0 ~ x if x < 0 By considering the signs of the numbers involved, it is easy to establish the following properties of the modulus: x:,;; lxl lx12 = x2 Ix· YI= lxl ·!YI •• EXAMPLES For all real numbers x and y, Ix+ YI;.;,; ixl + IYI· 2.2 AXIOMS FOR THE REAL NUMBERS 57 Solution If a, b E IR and a> b ~ 0 then a 2 > b 2 .

First, addition and multiplication of rationals pro- duce rationals. In other words, addition and multiplication restricted to Q x Q define functions from Q x C to Q. Secondly, axioms Al, A2, A5, A6 and Al0-A14 hold for any subset of~- Finally, 0 and 1 are rationals and the negatives and reciprocals of rationals are rational. Hence the remaining axioms hold. So :J is an ordered field. Hence, since it has been shown that there is no rational number whose square is two, the axioms of an ordered field cannot be sufficient to ensure the existence of the real number -v'2. This comes from the final axiom, which may be unfamiliar to the reader. 2.2.3 The completeness axiom A 15 Every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound. Note~· Every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound. (1) A subset S of R is said to be bounded above if there is some real number M such that x ~ M for all x E S. This M is called an upper bound for S. A subset S of ~ is said to be bounded below if there is some real number m such that m ~ x for all x E S. This m is called a lo~·er bound for S. (2) Any set satisfying Al-A15 is called a complete ordered field. Essentially, IR is the only complete ordered field, and so ax- ioms Al-Al5 characterize~- (3) The least upper bound is called the suprcmum of S, or sup S. The greatest lower bound is called the inti mum of S, or inf S. 58 THE REAL NUMBERS (4) One half of A15 is redundant (see Question 5 of Exercises 2.2). This final axiom is a subtle one, which will be discussed in more detail in the next section. To claim that an upper bound M. of a bounded set Sis the least upper bound or supremum of S is saying that M \"\"\" M 1 for any other upper bound M 1. Put another way, if M.' < M then there must exist at least one element x E s with x > Mr' thus preventing M' from being an upper bound and so making M the least upper bound. Similar remarks apply to the infimum of a bounded set. As will be seen, the completeness axiom is the one that guarantees the existence of irrational numbers such as \\12. Exercises 2.2 l.

Explain why one half of A15 is redundant. 2.3 THE COMPLETENESS AXIOM 59 2.3 The completeness axiom This section will prove that \\/2 exists as a real number. It will then prove that O! is not complete by showing that A 15 fails for O!. In other words, there are sets of rational numbers, bounded above. that do not possess a rational least upper bound. Consequently, the completeness axiom is the one that distinguishes Q from R. This section begins with a theorem that is a direct consequence of the completeness axiom. 2.3.1 The Archimedean postulate N is not bounded above. - Proof Suppose that !\\I is bounded above. In other words, there exists a real number M such that n ~ M for all n EN. By the completeness axiom, M can be chosen to be sup l'\\I. Now M - 1 cannot be an upper bound for 1\\1, and so there is a natural number m with M -1 < m. !'ow M < m + 1andm+1 EN, which contradicts the choice of M. Hence N is not bounded above. D Archimedes (287-212 Be) was a native of Sicily and the son of an astronomer. His writings are masterpieces of mathematical exposi- tion and are written in a manner that resembles modem journal articles. His most remarkable work on a method for finding areas (and volumes) by dividing the area into a large number of thin parallel strips is closely connected with the modern idea of definite integration. A copy of this work, called Method, was not discovered until 1906. It had been written in the tenth century on parchment, washed off in the thirteenth century and rcuised for a religious text. Luckily, the underlying text could be restored. The Method is a particularly significant work, since, although Archimedes' other treatises are logically precise, there is little hint of the preliminary analysis required in their formulation. Jn the Method. however, Archimedes describes, in detail, the 'mechanical' processes underly- ing most of his discoveries concerning areas and volumes. The prin- cipal reason why this is the only work where this vital background infonnation is provided is that Archimedes himself had profound reservations about the rigour of his 'method', in particular the as- sumption that an area is a sum of line segments. The Archimedean postulate that bears his name has been vari- OlL\">ly credited, and appears in the treatment of irrational numbers in the fifth book of Euclid's Elements. Little is known of the life of 60 THE REAL NUMBERS Euclid, but his seminal work, the Elements, represent the first full mathematical text preserved from Greek antiquity. There have been over 1000 editions of the \"13 books of the Elements since the inven- tion of printing. The books arc based on a strict logical i:leduetion of theorems from a set of definitions, postulates and axioms, and have influenced scientific thinking more than any other books. Another way of phrasing the Archimedean postulate is to say that, given any real number x, there exists an integer n ·with n ;;;;. x. • • EXA...\\1PLE 1 Prove that the supremum of S = {(n -1)/2n: n E !\\}is!· Solution Since (n -1)/2n = ! -1/2n and n is positive, Sis bounded above by!· Suppose that M <!is an upper bound for S.

Thus N is bounded above, which contradicts the Archimcdean postulate. Hence. no such M exists. In other words,! is the least upper bound of S. • •• EXAMPLE2 Identify the supremum and infimum of the following subsets of R: E1 = {l,2,3} Ez ~ {x: Ix - ll < 2} E3 = R+ E 4 = { x : 0 < x < 1 and the decimal expansion of x contains no nines} S\"lution Clearly sup E 1 = 3 and inf E 1 = 1. In fact, for any finite set the supremum is merely the maximum eJement and the infimum is the minimum element in the set. 2.3 THE COMPLETENESS AXIOM 61 1'ow lx-11<2 gives -l<x<3, and so supE 2 =3 and inf E 2 :-: -1. Note that neither the suprcmum nor the infimum is an element of E 2, since £ 2 contains neither a maximum nor a minimum element. . IF! ·1- is not bounded above and so sup E 3 does not exist; inf E 3 - 0, which is not an clement of H +. So R + does not contain a least element. E 4 contains arbitrariJy ~mall positive real numbers; however, the largest number it contains is 0.88888 ... which equals S. Thus sup E4 = ~ and inf E 4 = 0. • •• EXAMPLE3 Prove that if C = {x + y: x e A and y e B}, where A and B are non-empty sets of H: bounded above, then (.'is bounded above and sup C =sup A+ sup H. Solution Since A and H arc non-empty and bounded above, sup A and sup B exist. Then x + y .;;; sup A + sup B for all x e A and for all ye B, and hence C is bounded above. Clearly C is non-empty, and so sup C exists. l\\ow sup C ~~; sup A +sup H because, as has been demonstrated, sup A +!.up B is an upper bound for C. Sup- pose, by way of contradiction, that sup C -::::: sup A + sup H. Then sup C - sup B < sup A, and hence there exists an x' e A with sup C- sup H < x' (otherwise sup C--sup B would be an upper bound for A smaller than sup A : this contradicts the definition of a least upper bound). But now sup C- x' <sup B, and so there i.:x- ists a y' e B with sup C- x' < y 1 (otherwise sup C- x' would be an upper bound for B smaller than sup B). Finally then, sup C < x 1 + y ', contradicting the fact that sup C is an upper bound for C. The only conclusion now is that sup C-=- sup A +sup B, • It can now be proved that lf.J1 is a dense subset of n!; in other words, given any two real numbers x and y with x < y, there is a rational number r such that x < r < y, Although this may appear to be a conse- quence of the results obtained in Section 2.1, some of the arguments there depend on the unproved assertion that elements of ~. as axiomat- ized in Section 2.2, can be represented by infinite decimals. 2.3.2 Density of the rationals Let x, y e IR and x < y. There exists a rational number r, x < r < y. 62 THE REAL NUMBERS Proof By the Archimedean postulate an integer n can be chosen with n > 1/(y - x) > 0. Hence 1/n < y - x. Since nx and - nx are real numbers, there exist integers m and m 1 satisfying m > 1z.x and m' > -nx by the Archimedean postulate again. In other words, m' m ---<x <- n n Now there are a fin.ire number of integers from -m' tom, so the smallest one m\" can be selected with x < m\"/n. The element m\" exists, since every finite set has a minimal element. See Question 6 of Exercises 2.3. Therefore (m\" - 1)/n ..s: x and m\" m\" - 1 1 1 x < . - = + - ~ x + ·- < x + (y - x) = y n n n n Hence r = m''/n is a rational between x and y. c It can now be proved that \\/2, the positive square root of 2, exists. In other words, there is a real number M satisfying M. 2 = 2. To this end, let S = {x: x E IR 1 and x 2 ;;;:; 2}, a non-empty subset of ~. The set S is bounded above, since x 2 ~ 2--> x 2 ~ 4 ~ .x ~ 2. By the completencs.s axiom, S possesses a least upper bound. Call this least uprer bound M.. A proof hy contradiction is now emplo)·ed to prove that M = 2. Suppose that M 2 < 2 and consider M' = M + 1/n., n EN. Then (M.') 2 = M 2 + 2M + _1_ ~ M 2 + 2M + 1 n n 2 n since n. 2 ~ n. for all n E N. Now ( M') 2 < 2 provided that M2 + 2M + 1<2 n. which is equivalent to 2M + 1 n> ? 2- M- By 2.3.1, there exists an integer n satisfying this last inequality. Hence M' ES for such an n, and this contradicts the fact that M is an upper bound for S. 2.3 THE COMPLETENESS AXIOM Suppose now that M. 2 > 2, and let M'\"\" M -1/n, n EN. This time, (M')2 = Mz _ 2M + ~ ~ M 2 _ 2M n n- n 63 since 1/n 2 ~O for all n EN. Now (M') 2 >2 provided that M. 2 - 2M/n > 2, which holds when n > 2M/(M 2 - 2). Hy 2.3.l again, such an\" n exists. This contradicts the fact that M is the least upper bound of S. Therefore M 2 \"'\" 2 as desired. Now that the existence of V2 has been established and it is known that v'2 is not a rational number, it is possible to prove that the set :) of rational numbers is not complete. In other words, there exist bounded sets of rational numbers that do not possess a rational upper bound. Consider T = {x : ; E Q, x > 0 and .r 2 ~ 2}. Suppose that T has a rational least upper bound r. Since Tis a subset of S = {x: x c ~+ and x 2 \"=~ 2}, \\/2 is an {irrational) upper bound for T. Hence r < v'2. By 2.3.2, there is a rational r' such that r < r' < \\/2. But then (r') 2 < 2, and so r' ET. This contradicts the assertion that r is the supremum of T. Hence T docs not possess a rational least upper bound. Thus ·:J is not complete. This section concludes by stating the principle of mathematical induc- tion. This makes it possible to establish that certain results hold for all natural numbers n. 2.3.3 The principle of mathematical induction Let P(n) be a statement for each natural number n. If (a) P(l) is true, and (h) P(k) true~ P(k + 1) true for every k EN then P(n) is true for all n E l\\'\\J. This result, which can be deduced from the axioms for R, is really a statement about natural numbers. If (a) holds then P(l) is true. Hence, by (b), P(2) holds, and, hy (b) again, P(3) holds, and so on. To conclude that P(n) holds for all n EN amounts to the belief that ~ is the set {l, 1+1, 1+1+1, ... } or, as it is more commonly denoted, {l,2,3, ... }. •• EXAMPLE4 n Prove that L, r = ~n(n + 1) for all n E '\\. r=l 64 THE REAL NUMBERS Solution Let P( n) be the statement n 2: r = !n(n + 1) r=l Since 1=~1(1+1), P(l) is true. Now suppose that P(k) is true for a particular k e N. Then 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (k + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = !k(k + 1) + (k + 1) By factorization, !k(k + 1) + (k + 1) = !{k + l)(k + 2) Hence 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + Ck + 1) = Hk + 1)(k + 2) and so P(k + 1) is also true.

Crudely speaking, a sequence con- verges if the terms of the sequence approach arbitrarily close to a unique real number, called the limit of the sequence. As a concrete example, consider the problem of determining a deci- mal corresponding to the irrational number x = \\/2. Since x 2 = 2, some simple algebra gives the rather strange equation x 2 + 2 x=-- 2x This is of the form x = f(x), and such equations may often be solved by the method of iteration. This technique involves the generation of a sequence x 1, x 2, x 3 , ..• of real numbers, where the iteration formula 67 68 SEQUENCES Xn+i = f(xn) is used to generate successive terms of the sequence, given a starting value for x 1• The hope is that successive terms provide better and better approximations to a solution of the equation x = j:(x). The itera· tion formula x 2 + 2 n Xn+1 = -2-- Xn docs indeed generate a sequence of better and better approximation!'> to \\/2, a fact proved in Example 1 of Section 3.4. With x 1 = 1, the formula Xn-1 = (x~ + 2)/2.xn gives 1+2 X2=-2 -=1.5 (1.5) 2 + 2 X3 = --2(l:s)° = 1.417 (1.417) 2 -r 2 X4 = Z(l.4l?) = 1.4142 and so on. It can be shown that each successive term of this sequence is a better approximation to v'2 than previous terms by at least two decimal places, and so the decimal expansion of v2 can be found to any degree of accuracy required. It should be noted, however, that every term of the sequence of approximations to v'2 is a rational number, whereas the limit v'2 is not. The definition of a convergent sequence (3.1.1) appears early in Sec- tion 3.1; at first sight, the definition may seem rather obscure, and time will be needed for the reader to master the logic involved. Historically, it was not until the late nineteenth century that a satisfactory definition of convergence emerged as part of the efforts to place analysis on a rigorous non-intuitive footing. What the definition does is to make precise what is meant by the phrase 'approach arbitrarily close to'. The definition is then used to establish various rules that can be used to determine the limits of many convergent sequences. These rules require knowledge of the limits of certain basic sequences, namely convergent sequences with limit zero. These basic null sequences arc presented in Section 3 .2, and a general strategy for finding the limit of an arbitrary convergent sequence is de- scribed. Sequences that do not converge are called divergent sequences, and Section 3.3 is devoted to a study of those divergent sequences that diverge to plus or minus infinity. Finally, in Sect.ion 3.4 the principle of monotone sequences is proved, namely that any increasing (or decreas- ing) sequences whose terms arc bounded must converge. The require- ment in this result that the sequence be monotone is essential, since there are buundcd sequences, such as 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, ... , that are not con- 3.1 CONVERGENT SEQUENCES 69 vergent. What can be e~tablished, though, is the Bol:lano-Weierstra~s theorem, which states that every bounded sequence contains a convergent subsequence. This theorem is then used to develop a characterization of convergent sequences that, unlike Definition 3.1.1, does not need to refer to the limit of the sequence. The proofs of the theorems and of the numerous rules established in this chapter make extensive use of the completeness axiom for the real numbers. 3.1 Convergent sequences An infinite sequence a 1, 02, a3, .•• of real numbers may be specified either by giving a formula for the nth term, an, or by prescribing a method of generating the terms of the sequence. Such a sequence will be denoted by (a 11 ). •• EXAMPLE 1 Calculate the first five terms of the sequence (a,i) in the following cases: (a) a - n 11- (c) an= (-1) 11/n Solutions (b) an = 1 - 1/n (d) an= (-l)n In each case it is simply a matter of substituting n = 1, n = 2 up to n = 5 in the formula for an. This gives the follo.,ving: (a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... (b) 0 ·1 2 3 4 •'i>3\"•4•3'•··· (c) -1, ~. -}, ~. -t .. . ( d) -1, 1, - L ·1 , -1, .. . • The above example illustrates some general facts about sequem.:cs. Either the terms of a sequence are unbounded, or else there exists a real number M ~uch that Ian 1 -=~ M for all n e ~. In the latter case the se- quence (an) is sai<l to be a bounded sequence. With a bounded !-iCquence, the terms either oscillate without 'settling down', or else they tend to get closer to some fixed real number L. In the latter case (a,.) is \"aid to be cmwerging to L, and thh is denoted by an ~ L as n - oo. The number L is called the limit of the sequence (a 11 ). A sett.ucnce that does not con- verge is said to dh·erge; divergent sequtmccs are discussed in more detail in Section 3.3. 70 SEQUENCES Intuitively, it seems plausible that certain sequences converge while others do not. In Example 1 sequences (b) and (c) both converge (to the limits 1 and 0 respectively), but sequences (a) and (d) diverge, though in markedly different ways. However, in order to work seriously with con- vergent sequences, deduce their properties and decide whether or not a given sequence docs converge, a rigorous definition of the concept of convergence is required. Such a definition emerged only in the late nine- teenth century and al first sight seems daunting because of the subtleties of the logic involved. What the definition seeks to capture, in a very precise manner, is the idea that for a sequence (a,,) to converge to a limit L it is necessary that the terms of the sequence, from a certain point onwards, all lie within some previously specified (small) distance of L. 3.1.1 Definition A sequence (a,.) converges to a limit L if and only if for every f > 0 there exists a natural number N such that n > N => la,, - /,I < 1-:. l11is is denoted by a\"--+L as rz-:ic, or, alternatively, lim 11_, 00 a,,=L, when (a\") is a convergent sequence with limit L. Either statement is read as 'a,, tends to L as n tends to infinity'. The statement I a,, - LI < t: says that aPI - L lies, between -E:: and +e. Hence -1; <an - L < E, leading to L - E <an< L + E. Therefore Definition 3.1.1 says that (a,,) converges to L provided that for any specified e > 0, there is a term a . .,. of the sequence such that all subsequent terms lies between /. - e and L + s. This is illustrated in Figure 3.1, where, for the sequence depicted and the value of E given, a suitable value for N is 7; for n > 7 the terms a,, all lie inside the horizontal strip from L - E to L + f.. Another way of viewing a convergent sequence is to regard successive terms of the sequence as L+F. ---~·-· ---- -·--- ... - • • • L t • • • la3-LI • • L-F.

The E in Definition 3.1.1 then corresponds to a prescription of maximum error, and the N provided is such that all the terms corresponding to n > N approximate the limit to the degree of accuracy specified bye. The power of Definition 3.1.1 lics in the fact that a sequence (a 11 ) will converge to a limit L provided that for every e > 0 it is possible to find a suitable N. As it stands, Definition 3.1.1 defines precisely what a limit of a con- vergent sequence is, but docs not immediately imply that there is only one limit. However, a eonve.rgent sequence (a,i) has a unique limit. To see this, suppose that L and M were different limits of the convergent sequence (an)· Then, for any positive number E and all sufficiently large n, the terms of the sequence would approximate both L and M with a margin of error no more than e. But for small enough 1-: this would mean that the terms of the sequence eventually lay in two disjoint strips as illustrated in Figure 3.2 (the value of e shown is one-third of the distance between /,and M). This is impossible, and so a convergent sequence has a uniquely determined limit. •• EXAMPLE2 1 Prove that - -+ 0 as n ~ oo, n Solution It seems intuitively obvious that for large values of n, the recipro- cal 1/n is small and hence close to zero.

The reason that such tricks can be used is that the N required in Definition 3 .1.1 need not be the least possible such N . • These last two examples illustrate that the value of N depends very much on the value of e. In general, the smaller e is, the larger the value of N needs to be. Figure 3.3 details some possible values of E and a corresponding value of N when a,,= (4n + 1)/(2n - 1). It is clearly tedious to use the definition of convergence to prove that a 3.1 CONVERGENT SEQUENCES 73 E N 0·1 31 0·01 301 0·002 1501 Figure3.3 given sequence has a prescribed limit L. In fact. it may not be known what I., is! Once the following rules have been established, they can be used to evaluate the limits of quite complicated sequences from know- ledge of the limits of silJlple sequem:cs, like those in Examples 2 and 3. 3.1.2 Rules Suppose that (a,1) and (bn) are convergent sequem:cs with limits A and B respectively; then the following rules apply: Sum rule (aP! + bn) converges to A - H. Product rule (anbn) converges lo AB. Qllotient rule (a,,/b 11 ) converges to A/B, provided that b,. =fo 0 for each n and B=FO. Scalar product rule (ka 11 ) converges to kA for every real number k.

Now the quotient rule cannot be applied directly, since neither the numera- tor nor denominator of n2 + 2n + 3 4n2 + 5n + 6 converges to a finite limit. However, if the numerator and denominator are divided by the dominant term n 2 , the following is obtained: 1+2/n + 3/n 2 a \"\"' , n 4+5/n +6/n2 Hence n 2 + 2n + 3 1 + 2/n + 3/n 2 1 + 2·0 + 3·02 a= = --+ n 4n 2 + 5n + 6 4 + 5/n + 6/n 2 4 + 5·0 + 6·02 =* as n-oo freely using the sum, product, scalar product and quotient rules (see 3.1.2). • 3.1.3 Sandwich rule Let (an), (bn) and (en) be sequences satisfying an~ b,1 ~ Cn for all n e N.

This follows since the deletion of a finite number of terms from a sequence, or the addition of a finite number of new terms to a sequence, affects neither the convergence nor the limit. The final rule involves the concept of a continuous function. Intuitive- ly, a function f: A ~ IR whose domain A is a subset of R. is continuous if itr. graph is a continuous curve. The rigorous definition of continuity is given in Section 5.2. II turns out that elementary functions such as poly- nomials, sine, cosine and exponential functions arc all continuous on their domains. TI1e proof of 3.1.4 is delayed until Section 5.2. 3.1.4 Composite rule Let (a,,) be a convergent sequence with limit L and let f be a continuous function whose domain contains {an: n e F~l} and L.

Generating such a collection of basic sequences forms the substance of Sections 3.2 and 3.3. First note that if an - L as n - oo then the sequence (bn) given by bn =an - L converges to zero. The aim of the next section is to generate a collection of sequences that converge to zero. Such sequences are called null sequences. Exercises 3.1 1.

Appli- cation of the rules 3.1.2 gives immediately that if (a,.) and (b,1) are null sequences then so are the sequences (a,.+ bn), (anbn) and (kan), k ER. In addition, the following rule will prove useful. 3.2.1 Power rule If (an) is a null sequence where a,. ~ 0 for all n e N, and if p e R, p > 0, then (a~) is a null sequence. Proof For any e > 0 set e'-== E1iP. Since (an) is a null sequence and e' > 0, there exists a natural number N such that But an:;;;. 0 and p > 0, so la~ < (e')P = E for n > N. In other words, (a~) is a null sequence. D Proving that certain basic sequences are null sequences will require the use of the binomial expansion; for x e IR and n e N (1 +x)\" = ±(n)xk k=O k = 1 + nx + !n(n - l)x 2 + ... + xn where (n) n! k = k!(n - k)! This formula can be established by induction on n. 80 SEQUENCES 3.2.2 Basic null sequences The following are null sequences: (a) (l/n1'), for p > 0 (b) (en), for !cl< 1 (c) (nPcn), for p > 0 and lei< 1 (d) (cn/n!), force IR (e) (nP/n!), for p >0 Proof (a) By Example 2 of Section 3.1, (1/n) is a nuU sequence. Hence, by the power rule (3.2.1), (1/nP) is a null sequence for p > 0. (b) First note that a sequence (an) is null if and only if the se- quence Ciani) is null (see Question 1 of Exercises 3.2). It thus suffices to consider (en) when O-=.; c < 1. If c = 0, the sequence is clearly null, so it may be assumed that 0 < c < 1. Write c = 1/(1 + x), where x > 0. From the binomial expansion, (1 + x)n ;;-: 1 + nx;;:: nx for n e N and hence 1 1 O~c\" = '!I0:- (1 -!- x)n nx for n c ~ Since (1/n) is a null sequence, the scalar product rule (3.1.2) gives that (l/nx) is a null sequence. By the sandwich rule (3.1.3), (en) is a null sequence for 0 < c < 1. Therefore (c:\") is a null sequence for [cj < 1. (c) As in (b), it is sufficient to consider values of c satisfying 0 < c < I. Write c = 1/(1 + x), where x > 0, and first consider the case p = 1. From the binomial expansion, (1+x)11 ~1 + nx + ~n(n - l)x 2 2!: !n(n - l)x 2 for n;;:: 2 and hence ,, n 2n 2 0=E;;nc = -=.;; =---- (1 + x)n n(n - l)x 2 (n - l)x 2 for n;:;;;:: 2 3.2 NULL SEQUENCES 81 Since {1/n) is a null sequence, the rules (3.1.2) give that 2 ·---- · - ___,. 0 as n ___,. oo (n - l)x 2 By the sandwich rule (3.1.3), (nc\") is a null sequence. For the general case where p > 0 and 0 < c < 1, note that nPcn = (nd 11 )P, where d = c 1iP, for n E N Since 0 < d < 1 and (nd\") is a null sequence, the power rule (3.2.1) gives that (nPc\") is null for p > 0and0<c<1. Hence (nPc\") is a null sequence for p > 0 and lcl < 1. (d) It is sufficient to consider the case c > 0. By the Archimedean postulate (2.3.1 ), there exists an integer m with m + l > c. Then for n > m + 1 ~; = ( ~ )( ~) ... (~)(m: 1) ... (~ ~ 1)( ~) ~~ ( n(;) ... (~ )( :;) = ( ~~ )(:) = ~c where K = c\"'/m! is a constant. Now (1/n) is a null sequence, and so ( Kc/n) is a null sequence by the scalar product rule (3.1.2). Since 0 ~ c\"/n! ~ Kc/n for n > m + l, the sandwich rule (3.1.3) gives that (c\"/nt) is null. (e) For p > 0 write .!!___ = (.!!___)(~) for n E N nt 2\" n! By part (c) with c = !, (nP/2\") is null, and by part (d.) with c = 2, (2\" /n!) is null. Hence by the product rule (3.1.2), (nP /n !) is null. The following general strategy may now be applied to evaluate the limit of a complicated quotient of sequences: (1) Identify the dominant term. using knowledge of basic null sequences. (2) Divide both the numerator and denominator by the dominant term.

For example, the se- quences ((-l)n) and (n) are both divergent; although how to prove this by applying the definition of convergence (3.1.l) is unclear. The aim of this section is to provide criteria for divergence that avoid the need to argue directly from 3.1.l. Inddentally,'showing that (a,.) is not converg- ent amounts to proving that the sequence (an - /.) is not null for any value of L. The c1iteria will be developed by establishing properties that are possessed by convergent sequences; if a sequence does not have these properties then it must be divergent. Recall that a sequence (an) is bounded if lanl ~ M for some real number M, for all n E ~- The proof of the following result appeared in the proof of the product rule (3.1.2). 3.3.1 Result If (an) is convergent then (a,.) is bounded. An immediate consequence of this result is that an unbounded se- quence is necessarily divergent. 3.3 DIVERGENT SEQUENCES 85 •• EXAMPLE 1 Classify the following sequences as bounded or unbounded, and as convergent or divergent. (a) (1 + (-l)n) (b)((-l)nn) (c) (~) (d) (2n) n + 1 Solutilm (a) Bounded, since 1+(-l)n=0 or 2 depending on whether n is odd or even. Intuitively, the sequence (1 + (-t)n) is divergent - a fact that will be demonstrated later in this section. (b) Unbounded. since fur any real number M there exists an in- teger n such that 2n > M, and (- l)\".?n2n = 2n is a term of the given sequence. Hence ((-l)nn) is divergent by the contra- po8itivc of 3.3.1. (c) Since 2n/(n- l)-+2 as n-+oo, (2ni(n + 1)) is a convergent sequence. Hence, by 3.3.1, (2n/(n ..-1)) is bounded. (d) t:nbounded, using a similar argument to that in (b) above. Hence, by the contrapositive of 3.3.1, (211) is divergent. • Note that there are bounded divergent sequences, as the example of (I+ (-1)\") demonstrates. This shows that the converse of 3.3.1 is false; in Section 3 .4 some partial converses will be presented. Also observe that, although both ( ( -1) nn) and (2n) arc unbounded, and hence are divergent. they behave in different ways. The terms of both become arbitrarily large, but in the sequence (2n) they also remain positive. This notion of the terms of an unbounded sequence becoming large and posi- tive is formalized in the next definition. 3.3.2 Definition A sequence (a 11 ) tends to infinity if and only if for every posi- tive real number K there exists an integer N such that n > N =;-- an > K. This is denoted by an-+ x as n-+ oo. or, alternatively, limn-+\"\" an= 'JC. The latter notation is a liule unfortunate, since it seems tu suggc'it that oo is a real number. This is not the case; the statement Jim,._.,., an = x only expresses the fact that a,. is arbitrarily large and positive for sufficiently large positive values of n. Note immediately that if (u,.) tends to infinity, it is unbounded and hence (an) is divergent. 86 SEQUENCES •• EXAMPLE2 Show that n2 lim---= oo n~co 2n - 1 Solution Observe that n2 n2 -··--> - for all n e N Zn - 1 2n Also, n 2 /2n = ~ n > K, provided that n > 2K. For K e IR, choose N to be any integer exceeding 2K . Hence ni n > N => n > 2K ==- !n > K => 2 > K n-1 In other words, n 2/(2n - 1)-+ oo as n-+ oo • The above example demonstrates that, as with convergent sequences, arguing directly from a formal definition can prove technically demand- ing. The following rules, whose proofs are left as an exercise, may be used to identify sequences that tend to infinity. 3.3.3 Rules Suppose that (an) tends to infinity and (bn) tends to infinity; then the following hold: Sum rule (an + b11 ) tends to infinity Product rule (a,1bn) tends to infinity Scalar product rule (kan) tends to infinity for any positive real number k Basic null sequences (3.2.2) may also be used in the identification of sequences that tend to infinity, as the following result shows. 3.3 DIVERGENT SEQUENCES 87 3.3.4 Reciprocal rule Suppose that (an) is a sequence whose terms are eventually positive and (1/an) is null. Then a,1 - oo as n- oc. Proof The phrase 'eventually positive' means that there exists an integer N 1 such that a11 > 0 for all n > lV 1 . Let K be a positive real number. Then E = l/K > 0. Since (l/a,i) is null, there exists an integer N 2 such that n > N 2 :-> l/a 11 i < t'. For such values of n, la11 > 1/e = K. Choose 1V to be the greater of N 1 and ;~r '2· Then n > N =:>- a11 = la,, I > K In other words, a,, --lo :x:· as n --lo oo. D •• EXAMPLE3 Prove that ( n ! - 2 11 ) tends to infinity. Solution The sequence (n~ - 2 11 ) is eventually positive since, by Question 5(c) of Exercises 2.3, nl > 2\" for all n ~ 4. Also, 1 1/n! 0 ---- - -- = 0 as n - oc 1-2 11/n! 1-0 using the basic null sequences (3.2.2) and the rules for convergent sequences (3.1.2). By the reciprocal rule, n! - 2\" - oo as n- oc . • A sequence (a 11) tends to minus infinity if the sequence (-a,,) tends to infinity. This is written as a11 --lo - \"° as 11 --lo cc, or lim n-+oo an = - oo. Se- quences that tend to minus infinity are unbounded and hence are diverg- ent. However, not all unbounded sequences tend to either infinity or minus infinity. For instance, consider the unbounded sequence (a 11 ) given by a,,= (-l)\"n. in which the terms alternate in sign. The sequence ob- tained by writing down only the even terms a2 , a 4 , afi, ... is a sequence that tends to infinity and hence is divergent. As will be seen shortly, this is sufficient to prove that (an) is divergent. The sequence obtained by writing down the odd terms a 1 , a~, a5 , ••• is also a divergent sequence (which tends to minus infinity). In a similar vein, if the sequence (a,.) is given by an= 1 + (-1)\", the sequence obtained by writing down the even 88 SEQUENCES terms is 0, 0, 0, ... and the sequence obtained by writing down the odd terms is 2, 2, 2, ... These both converge, but to different limits; again, as will be seen, this suffices to prove that (a,,) is divergent. Clearly it is of interest to consider sequences obtained by restricting the subscripts of the On to be some increasing sequence of natural numbers. 3.3.5 Definition The sequence (a 11,) is a subsequence of the sequence (a 11 ) if (n,) is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers. Certain properties of sequences arc inherited by their subsequences, as the fol1owing results shows. 3.3.6 Result Suppose that (an,) is a subsequence of (an): (i) if an - L as n - oo then a11• - L as ,. _ co (ii) ifa,,---=> oo as n - oo then an, - oo as r - oo Proof {i) Since a11 - L as n- oo, for each e > 0 tbere exists an integer N such that n > N =>Jan - Lj < c Choose R such that nR ~ N. Then In other words, an,-+ L as r - oo. (ii) is left as an exercise. D This result leads directly to two useful criteria for establishing the diverg- ence of certain sequences. These strategics validate the claims made earli- er concerning the (divergent) sequences (1 + (-1)\") and ((-l)nn). Strategy 1 The sequence (an) is divergent if {an) has two convergent subsequences with different limits. 3.3 DIVERGENT SEQUENCES 89 Strategy 2 The sequence (un) is divergent if (a,,) has a subsequence that tends to infinity or minus infinity. •• EXAMPLE4 Prove that ( (-l)\"n _±_!.) 2n - 1 is a divergent sequence.

In Section 3.3 techniques for showing that certain sequences are divergent were developed. But an arbitrary sequence (an) may not yield to any of these methods, and hence whether or not (an) is convergent may be left unanswered. However, it is some- times possible to prove that a sequence is convergent, even though its limit is unknown. This situation arises for certain bounded sequences, as the first result in this section establishes. Some new terminology will be required first. An increasing sequence (an) is one in which a11 :s: On+ I for all n e N. Similary, a decreasing sequence (an) is one in which an~ a 11+1 for all n e ~-A sequence that is either increasing or decreasing is called a mono- tone sequence. Note that not all sequences are monotone. 3.4.1 Principle of monotone sequences A bounded monotone sequence is convergent. Proof The result for a bounded monotone increasing sequence is proved, the proof being similar for a decreasing sequence. Let (an) be such that 01 ~ a2 ~ ..• and Ian I..=:; M for all n e N. Let M 0 = sup {an : n e N}, the least upper bound of the set of numbers appearing in the sequence; M 0 exists by the completeness axiom for the real numbers (see 2.2.3). Given E>O, Mo-s cannot be an upper bound for {an}· Hence there exists a value of N such that aN > M 0 - e. If n > N then Un~ uN, and so an> Mo - E. Furthermore, Un~ Mo by 3.4 MONOTONE SEQUENCES 91 Mn,___ _____ _ • • ' • • • • • N Figure3.4 the definition of M 0 , and hence, for n > N, :an - Mui< e. This proves that a11 -+ Mo as n-+ :x:.

Solution First of all, observe that if the sequence does converge it must do so to \\1'2. To see this, suppose that a11 -+ L as n-+ oo, where L * 0. Then Un+l-+ Las n--+ r (why is this so'?). By the product, sum and reciprocal rules, a 2 + 2 II ---2an L 2 +2 2L as n-+ oo and so, by the uni~ueness of limits, L = (L 2 + 2)/2L. Solving for L gives L -=- ± \\12. As will be shown below, a11 ?.: v'2 for all n > 1, and so L = \\12, as claimed. To complete the argument, it is now necessary to prove that (a11) is indeed a convergent sequence. Two facts will be established (i) an ~ Vz for all n > 1 (ii) a 11+1 ~ an for all n > 1 92 SEQUENCES For (i), note that using the inequality x 2 + y 2 ::== 2xy (why docs this inequalily hold?).

Hence, by the principle of monotone sequences, (a,.) is convergent. Since a11 ,:;;. -\\12 for all n > 1, the limit L of the sequence is non-zc.ro, and hence the earlier argu- ment shows that a\" ~ \\/2 as n ~ oo. • • • EXAMPLE 2 A sequence (a,,) is defined by a 1 = 1 and 0 11+1 = ~ for n ;io 1.

In fact, Jimn ... cc (1 + l/n)n = e (see after Example 5 in Se(..1ion 6.2). Jn elementary texts, e is defined to be the limit of the se- quence ((1+1/n)\"), but in practice it is more convenient to define e via the exponential function, a topic discussed in Section 4.3. • The principle of monotone sequences is dearly a partial converse to the result that every convergent sequence is bounded (3.3. t). The next result is also a partial converse to 3.3.1. 3.4.2 Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem Any bounded sequence (an) of real numbers contains a con- vergent subsequence. Proof Let SN= {a11 : n > N}. If every SN has a maximum element then define a subsequence of (an) as follows: b1 = an 1 is the maximum of St. b2 = an1 is the maximum of Sn,• b;i =a,., is the maximum of S\"\" and so on. Therefore (b11 ) is a monotone decreasing sub- sequence of (an). Since (a\") is bounded. so too is (bn). By 3.4.1, (b 11 ) is a convergent subsequence of {a,i). On the other hand, if, for sume M, SM does not have a maxi- mum element then for any am with m > M there exists an a 11 following am with an> am (otherwise the largest of aM+l• ... , am would be the maximum of SM)· Now let c1 = aM+I and let c2 be the first term of (an) follov.'ing c 1 for which c 2 > c1 • Now let c3 he the first term of (a.,) following c2 for which c3 > c2, and so on. Therefore (c11 ) is a monotone increasing subsequence of (a11). Since (c11 ) is bounded, 3.4.1 implies that (en) is a convergent sub- sequence of (an)· ---' Bernhard Bolzano (1781-1848) was a priest living in Prague whose mathematical discoveries were largely ignored in his lifetime. They were 'rediscovered' by subsequent mathematicians whose names ad- orn many of his results. The exception to this is the Balzano-Weier- 3.4 MONOTONE SEQUENCES 95 strass theorem. This reflects the fact that it was Weierstrass who independently (and some 80 years later) constructed functions ori- ginaJly discovered by Balzano - functions whose behaviour con- flicted with the 1'ewlonian ideal that curve~ were generated by smooth and continuous motion, with only isolated abrupt changes. Bolzano found curves with no tangent at any point! His posthumous WfJTk, Paradoxes of the Infinite, appeared in 1850 and contained a version of the Balzano-Weierstrass theorem later made famou..-. to mathematicians by Weierstrass. Karl Weierstra.'i.'!I (1815-1897) was renowned as a great and influen- tial teacher. Originally he studied law and finance and taught in elementary school until he was 40. Weierstrass then became an instructor at the University of Berlin and obtained a full professor- ship in 1864. From then on, he devoted himself tu advanced mathe- matics. His greatest contribution to mathematics was the founding of a theory of complex functions on power series, but it was his recognition of the need for the arithmetization of analysis that earned him the nickname of 'the father of modern analysis'. Weier- strass' great gifts as a teacher allied with his careful attention to logical reasoning in the field of analysis established an ideal fur future generations of mathematicians. His death in 1897 was exactly 100 years after the first published attempt (by Lagrange) at a rigor- ous calculus. An important consequence of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is that it is now possible to fonnuJate a definition of convergence for a sequence (an) that does not explicitly involve the limit L of that se- quence. First note thac if a,, -7 /, as n -7 co then for any given c > 0 there exii-.L<>, by 3.1.1, a natural number N such that Suppose now that m, n > N; then ~'am - L, + jL - a,, < !1:· + !c = c In other words, any two tem1s of the convergent sequence after an appro- priate arv differ by no more than the E originally specified. This Cauchy condition can now be used to define the concept of a Cauchy sequence. 96 SEQUENCES 3.4.3 Definition A sequence (an) is a Cauchy sequence if and only if for every e > 0 there exists a natural number N such that m, n > N => iam -a,11 < e. What is surprising is that all Cauchy sequences are convergent, and hence that the Cauchy condition gives a characterization of convergence that involves no reference to the limit in question. 3.4.4 Theorem A sequence (an) is C<.lnvergent if and only if (an) is a Cauchy sequence. Proof It has already been demonstrated that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence. For the converse, suppose that (an) is a Cauchy sequence. Then for E == l there exists a natural number N such that In particular, lam - a.v+il < 1 for all m > N Therefore the set S ={am : m > N} is a bounded set. Since S contains all but a finite number of terms of (an), the sequence (an) is itself bounded. By the Bolzano- Weierstrac;s theorem (3.4.2), (an) contains a convergent sub- sequence (an.)· Suppose that an, - L as r- oo. Then, given e > 0, there exists a natural number N 1 such that Since (a,,) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists a natural number N 2 such that 3.4 MONOTONE SEQUENCES t-;ow let N be the maximum of /\\/ 1 anti T\\\"2 . Then for n, n,. > N la,, - LI = l(an - an) + (a,,, - nl ~ la,, - a,,,'. + la,,, - LI 97 Jn other words, (a,,) converges to L, and so (a,,) is a convergent sequence as required. • Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was a prolific French analyst whose contributions to research include work on the convergence and divcrgcnce of infinite series. Ile developed a theory of real and complex functions, and published papers on differential equations, determinants, probability theory and mathcmatical physics. In 1821 he successfully developed an acceptable theory of limits, and de- fined convergence, continuity, differentiability and integrability in terms of this limit concept. Our present definitions of these same concepts are essentially those given by Cauchy. Cauchy wrote books at all levels and took great pride in communicating his discoveries to ulhers in relatively clear terms. For instance, his definition of limit reads: When successive values attributed to a variable approach indefinitely a fixed value so as to end by differing from it by as little. as one wishes, this last is called the limit of all the others. (A not dissimilar definition is also attributed to Balzano.) Exercises 3.4 1. Determine which of the following sequences arc monotone: .

CHAPTER FOUR Series 4.1 Infinite series 4.2 Series tests 4.3 Power series 4 Absurdities arising from the indiscriminate use of infinite series were among the catalysts for attempts to introduce rigour into analysis. However, as pointed out in the Prologue, paradoxes of the infinite had been in existence since the time of Ancient Greece. For instance, the Greek philosopher Zeno claimed that it was impossible to travel any distance, since to do so required one to first travel half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on. Since some distance always re- mained. one could not complete the journey. The essence of this paradox was the feeling that it was impossible to 'add up' an infinite number of positive quantities and obtain a finite answer. However, the distance from 0 to 1 can be split up into an infinite sequence of distances !. !. k, ... as shown in Figure 4.1, and, as will be shown in Example 1 of Section 4.1, ~+1+h+ ... =1 Nevertheless, the temptation to treat these 'infinite sums' as if they were exceedingly long finite sums has to he resisted. For, suppose that it \\Vere possible to add up the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16 •... and that the resulting 0 + Figure4.1 ir IOI 102 SERIES sum was S. Then 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... = s Multiplying throughout by! gives 1 + 2 + 4 + s + ... = ts Therefore 1 + S =ts, leading to the nonsensical result that S = -2. To avoid such absurdities, a careful definition of the sum of (converg- ent) infinite series is required. This is given in Section 4.1, where some elemcnt<try properties of convergent series are also e:srablished. In Sec- tion 4.2 several tests are developed for testing whether ur not a given series is convergent. The important concept of absolute convergence is discussed; in crude terms, absolutely convergent series can be manipu- lated much like finite sums without any absurdities arising. The set..1ion finishes with a suggested strategy for testing an arbitrary series for con- vergence. In Section 4.3 infinite series consisting of ascending powers of a real number x are dealt with. Such series are used to give rigorous defini- tions of elementary functions such as the exponential and trigonometric functions. 4.1 Infinite series If a sequence (an) is given, the finite sum ,,.n = (a 1 + a2 + ... + an) for each n E N can be formed. If (sn) converges to some limit s then s can justifiably be called the sum of the infinite sel\"ies L ar = a1 + a2 + · · · r-1 To be precise, the series 2: ~=la, is a convergent series, with sum s, if and only if the sequence (.,·n) of nth partial sums converges to s. If (s,,) is a divergent sequence then, irrespective of its precise behaviour, L ~=I ar is called a divergent series. Rather regrettably, L~=1a, is still used tu de- note a divergent series, even though it does not possess a sum. •• EXA..\\.1PLE 1 Show that f + l + A + ... has sum 1.

Note that the summation here begins at r = 0 and not at r = I. For this series the sum of the first n terms is Sn = a + ax + ax 2 + ... + ax 11 - 1 104 SERIES so xs11 =ax+ ax 2 + ... + axn, and, by subtraction, a(l - xn) s = 11 1 - x for x-:/= 1 If !xi< 1, (x 11 ) is a basic null sequence (3.2.2), and hence a s -+-- as n-+ oo n 1 - X If x > 1, (x 11 ) tend<; to infinity by application of the reciprocal rule (3.3.4) to the null sequence (1/x\"). If x < -1, (x 11 ) contains the subsequence (x 211 ), which tends to infin- ity, and therefore, by Strategy 2 of Section 3.3, (x 11 ) diverges. Hence (s,,) diverges for lxl > 1. If x = -1, the subsequences (s2 11 ) and (szn-i) converge to different limits, and so (sn) is divergent by Strategy 1 of Section 3.3. If x = 1, s 11 = na ~ oo as n ~ oo. Thus (s,,) converges if and only if lxl < 1. This gives the following result. 4.1.1 Result The geometric series L axr =a+ ax + tu 2 + . . . (a 1= 0) r=O converges if and only if lxi < 1. Moreover, its sum is then a/(l - x). Since the sum of a convergent series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of nth partial sums of the series in question, the results of Section 3.1 can be used to establish theorems concerning series. The first result provides a useful test for the divergence of series. 4.1.2 The vanishing condition If 2: ;==l ar is convergent then (an) is a null sequence. Proof Suppose that (sn) converges to some limit s. Hence (sn-i) also converges to s. But a11 = Sn - Sn·-1' and so an~ 0 as n-+ oo. D The contrapositive statement corresponding to 4.1.2 is of most use in applications; namely, if (a 11) is not a null sequence, then L:;=l ar is diver- gent. 4.1 INFINITE SERIES 105 •• EXAMPLE4 Consider L~=J r/(r + 1). Now a,.= ni(n +· 1) and an-'; 1-f-:O as n- oo. By the vani!'hing condition, L~=1 r/(r+1) is a divergent series. • It is important to note that the converse of the vani~hing condition is false! Tn other words, there an; divergent series whose terms nevertheless tend to zero. •• EXAMPLE5 Consider 2:;:..1 (Yr - Yr -1).

The last of these results, the integral test (see 4.2.5), will be used to prove the following. 4.1.5 Result The p·series L ~=1 1/r'' converges if p > 1 and diverges if p~l. The p-series, together with the geometric series, gives a fund of known convergent and divergent series. The next two examples examine the p-series with p = 1andp=2. •• EXAMPLE6 lnc harmonic series L ;'=1 1/ r diverges.

Hence sn < s.rv < 3. Therefore (.\\'n) is an increasing sequence that is bounded above. By 3.4.1, (s,1) converges. In other words, L;~1 l/r 2 converges. An alternative method of proof is given in Question 2 of Exercises 3.4. • As can he seen from the previous two examples, it is in general not possible to find a simple formula for the nth partial sums of a given series. Also, although having successfully determined the behaviour of L~=11/r2, the actual sum cannot be determined. For the interested reader, the sum of L ~=l 1/ r 2 is !r.2 , but the proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this book. The reader will have to be content with tests that establish that certain series converge but do not determine what the sum in question is. Exercises 4.1 1. Show that 1 1 r for r E ~ ---=--- r!

L,;.,,1 a, converges, and, since the addition of a finite number of terms to a convergent series produces another convergent series, 2: ~=la, converges. This proves that 2: ~~1 b, is convergent implies that 2: ~-·i a, is convergent. The converse of this statement can be proved by reversing the roles of a11 and b 11 in the above argument and observing that b11/a11 - l/L as n - t:o.

TI1e son of 112 SERIES the aristocratic sister of a cardinal, d' Alembert was abandoned near the church of Saint Jean-le-Rond when a newly-born infant. He is renowned for his contributions to kinetics and his work on the solu- tion of partial differential equations. He showed interest in the foundations of analysis, and was responsible, in 1754, for suggesting that analysis needed to be placed on firm foundations by the devel- opment of a sound theory of limits. Little heed was paid to this suggestion during his lifetime. However, in 1797 Lagrange (who ranked with Euler as an outstanding eighteenth-century mathemati- cian) attempted to provide a rigorous foundation for analysis, and in 1821 Augustin-Louis Cauchy successfully executed d'Alcmhert's suggestion . •• EXAMPLE3 Determine those values of x for which }:~~1 r(4x 2Y is convergent.

Jn particular, the first step above rearranges the terms of the original series. A rearrangement of a given series is another series containing precisely the same terms as the original series, but in a different order. There is no reason to expect that the rearranged series has the same sum as the original series, nor even that the rearranged series is convergent! Luckily, a.c; will be seen, a large class of series can be rearranged without affc(,'ting their sum. A series L ~=l ar is called absolutely convergent if the associated series L~=t ia,1 is convergent. 4.2 SERIES TESTS 115 4.2.6 'fheore111 .}: ;'=1 a, absolutely convergent~ L ~-1 a, convergent Proof Let a+ - {an n - 0 By definition, a~ :;;a!: 0 and a;~ 0 for all n e \"\"· if an :s; 0 if an;:;;. 0 Also lanl =a~+ a;;.

By virtue of the proof of 4.2.6, at least one, and in fact both, of L~-1 a: and ,2;=1 a;: must diverge. The paradox concerning the conditionally convergent series 2 ~=l (-1v-i /r that was seen earlier can now be explained by the next result. 4.2.7 l'heorern If L ~~ta, is conditionally convergent (with sum s) and s' e IR then the series can be rearranged to converge to s'. Proof Since L ~=i a, is conditionally convergent, both of the series 2 ;_1 a: and L ~-1 a;: are divergent, and both consist of positive terms only. Hence the partial sums of L~=t a; increase without bound, and so for any real number s' there exists a positive integer n 1 such that Ti= at+ ai + ... +a:,> s' Moreover, if n 1 is chosen to be the least positive integer with this property then ai + ai + ... + a~,-1 ~ s', and so T 1 - a:,~ s'. Therefore 0 <Ti - s' ~a;,, and so IT1 - s'' ~a~,. Since the par- tial sums of ,2;\"=1 a;: also increase without bound, there exists a positive integer n2 such that T2 = T 1 - (a!+ ai + ... + a;2) = (ai + ai + ... +a:,) - (al+ a2 + ... + a;;2) 116 SERIES If n 2 is chosen to be the least positive integer with this property then T2 +an 2 ';;;!:s'.1berefore O<s-Tz~a;;2, and so IT2-s'!~ a ;;2• Now choose n 3 to be the least positive integer such that T3 ::::: T2 + (a~1+1 + a:,+2 + ... + a;3) - ( + .. +) - ( - - . - ) - a 1 + a2 + ... + an, a1 + a2 + ... ..,... an, + (a:,+1 + a:,...i + ... + a~J >s' This choice of n 3 guarantees that IT 3 - s'I ~a : 3 • This process of adding on sufficiently many positive terms from the original series to once again produce a total exceeding s', followed by the addition of sufficiently many negative terms to take the accumulated total below s' again, can be continued. The end result is a rearrangement of L~~1 ar in which the particular partial sums Ti, T 2 , T 3 , ••• arc alternately greater than and then less than s', and in which ITn -s'I is less than or equal to some term of ~ ~=l lari. By construction, any partial sum S,, of this re- arranged series lies between Tm and Tm 1 1 for a suitable integer m (or equals one of Tm or Tm 11). If mis even then Tm~ Sn~ Tm •1' and if m is odd then the inequalities are reversed. In either case, arguing as in the proof of the sandwich rule for sequences (3.1.3), ISn-s'I is less than or equal to the maximum of ITm-s'I and !Tm+t - s'j. Hence the partial sums S1, S2 , S 3, •.• of the· re- arranged series are such that ISn - s'I is less than or equal to some term of 2;=1 la,j. But 2;=1 larl is a convergent series, and so, by the vanishing condition (4.1.2), larl-+0 as n-+oc. Therefore I Sn - s' I ---+ 0 as n-+ oo, and so the partial sums of the rearranged series converge to s'. In other words, ~ ~=l ar can be rearranged to produce a series converging to any real number ~·'. D In complete contrast, rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series produces an absolutely convergent series whose sum is the same as the sum of the original series. 4.2.8 The rearrangement rule If 2: ~=la, is absolutely convergent and ~ ;_ 1 br is any rear- rangement of L~=1 a, then ~;~1 br is absolutely convergent and 00 L br = La, r=l r=l 4.2 SERIES TESTS 117 Proof Assume that a,, :?-: 0 for all n e '\\;.

The interest in power series is twofold. They arise naturally in differential calculus, where, under suit- able conditions, a function f can be written as 4.3 POWER SERIES 121 , f\"(O) 2 f(x)-= /(0) + f (O)x + 2! · x + ... This particular power series is called the Maclaurin series for f and is discussed fully in Section 6.3. Power series arc also used to give rigorous definitions of the elementary fum .. 1ions. This is cliscussed at the end of this section. Since a power series gives a purticular series for each real value of x, its convergence will depend on x. Clearly any power series converges when x =0. 4.3.1 Theorem The set of values of x for which the power scric.., L: ;\"=0 b,..:tr converges is an interval with midpoint zero. Proof There are three mutually exclusive possibilities: (i) L ;=o b,x' converges only for x = 0; (ii) L ~~o b,x' converges for all real x; (iii)}\": ~-o b,x' converges for some x -r 0 and diverges for some x=FO. The result follows immediately in cases (i) and (ii). Now consider case (iii) and suppose that L ~ ... 0 b,x' converges for x = x 1. Hy the vanishing condition (4.1.2), b.,xi'~O as n~ oo. Hence {b.,x]) is bounded, and so there is some number M for which ib.,x II ~ M for all n E '\\I If x 2 satisfies lx21 < lx11 then lx2I t = T;J < 1 Now lb,,x~I = lb,,xilt\" ~Mt\" But 2: ~=0Mt' is a convergent geometric ~cries (4.1.1 ), and so, by the first comparison test (4.2.1), 2:;\"=0 lb,x 2 '1 is convergent. ~~ I Hence L,,r=ob,x2 ' is absolutely convergent and hence convergent. Therefore L ;_o b,x' converges for jX I < Ix 1 I- Let S = { c : c > 0 and L~=ob,x' converges for I.xi< c}. Since lx1I ES, S is non- empty. Also, since there exists a y :;t: 0 such that }.: ~=o b,y' is 112 SERIES divergent, d ~ S for all d > IYI by the first comparison test (4.2.1). Therefore Sis bounded above. Let k =sups. Then k-;;:. lx11 >0. Now suppose lxl < k, so that, hy the definition of k, there is an le S with ixl < l < k and such that L~=obrxr is convergent. Hence k e· S. In other words, L~-ob,xr converges for lxl < k. If it were possible for L ~-o brYr to converge for IY I > k then, as previ- ously demonstrated, }: ;;,,.0 hrx7 would converge for Ix I < IY I, and so I y; e S, which would contradict the fact that k = sup S. There- fore L~.,,0 b,x' diverges for lxl > k. This establishes the theorcm.D The set of real numbers x for which ~ ~ .. 0 b,x' converges is called the interval of convergence, which (excluding the cases where the given series converges only for x = 0, or converges for all x) is one of the intervals I- R, R], (- R, R], [-R, R) or (-R, R), where R is called the radius of convergence. If the power series converges only for x-= 0, the interval of convergence is {O} and the radius of convergence is taken to be R = O~ if the power series converges for all real values of x, the interval of converg- ence is IR and the radius of convergence is, hy convention, R -= oo. Now the proof of 4.3.1 shows that a power series is absolutely convergent for lxi < R. It could be absolutely convergent at x = ±R, but may be condi- tionally convergent, or even divergent, at one or both of the endpojnts of the interval of convergence. •• EXAMPLE 1 The power series L ~=t xr /r has interval of convergence [-1, 1). Solulion Apply the ratio test to i1 l~J = ~1 !x}' for x =I= 0 Since an= ixi\"/n, an-I ix!\"+l n a =--=-·---- n Un n + 1 !xi\" ( 1 )-1 = 1 +-; lxl Now an-+ lxl as n-+ oo. By 4.2.3, the power series converges (absolutely) for Ix < 1 and diverges for !xi> l. Hence iLoi; radius of convergence js R = 1. To determine the interval of convergence, examine the behaviour uf the serjes at the points x = ::::1 (where 4.3 POWER SERIES 123 the ratio test gives no. information). At x = l the series is L;=1 t/r, the divergent harmonic series. At x = -1 the series is ~~=i(-1Y/r, a convergent alternating series. Hence the required interval of convergence is [ -1. 1). • 4.3.2 Arithmetic of power series Let L ;\"=0 a,x' and L ~=O b,x' be power series with radii of convergence R 1 and R2 respectively, where 0 < R 1 ~ R 2 • Then the \"\" sum L(a, + b,)x' r~o scalar pri>duct and Cauchy product ,,. L:c,x' r=O (with c,1 = ~ a,b,,_,) r=O all have radius of convergence at least R1. Moreover, if L~-oa,x' has sum /(x) and L~=0b,x' has sum g(x) then ..

To establish the Cauchy product result, note that L ~=o a,x' and L~=ob,x' arc absolutely convergent for !xi< R1• Since n CnX\" = L (a,x')(bn_,x\" · ') r=O L~=0c,x' is absolutely convergent for !xi< R 1 by 4.2.9 and has the sum stated. 0 Much of the preceding discussion can be modified to apply to series of the form L ~=O a,(x - a)'. For example, the ratio test ( 4.2.3) may often be employed to determine the interval of convergence, an interval with a as its midpoint. Such series arise in Section 6.3. Finally, this chapter hricfly describes one approach to defining the elementary functions sine, cosine and exponential. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with these functions and their properties only in order to motivate and illustrate the theoretical results arising in later chapters. In fact, they have already been used in this chapter. However, they have not been used in the logical development of the theory. This ensures that the theoretical results have been derived in a rigorous manner. Naturally, once the elementary functions have been formally defined, a start can be made to deduce their many and varied properties. Suppose then that L;_0 a11x 11 is a power series with radius of converg- ence R > 0, and that f(x) is its sum for Ix I < R. This defines a function f: (- R, R)- R given by f(.x) = 2, ;=O a,,xn. Note that, for each x in the domain of f, f(x) is the limit of the sequence {f'IJ(x)} of Nth partial sums, where fN(x) = L~-oa11x\" is a polynomial in x. The Appendix shows that the sum function f(x) inherits important analytical properties of the polynomials f.v(x). The exponential, sine and cosine functions can now be defined as follows. 4.3.3 Definition The exponential function exp: IR-+ IR is given by \"' n expx= L ~ n=O n. 4.3 4.3.4 Definition The sine function sin: R-+ ill is given by , \"- (- l)n x211+l smx = L ------·-·· n=O (2n ...;.. 1)! 4.3.5 Definition The cosine function cos: IR- IR is given by \"'., (-l)\"x2n cosx = 2: -·--- 11-0 ' (2n)! POWER SERIES 125 The ratio test establishes immediately that these power series con- verge (ahsolutely) for all x e IR, After reading Chapters 5- 7, the reader can consult the Appendix, where the above power series definitions of the elementary functions are used to establish the analytic properties of those functions that are assumed in Chapters 5-7. For the time being, the reader can be content with the derivation of some arithmetic properties of the elementary functions. •• EXAMPLE2 exp(x + y) = expxexpy fur all x, y E 'R SfJlution Dy definition, oc x\" « n exp x = 2: - 1 and exp y = L .X..,- 11-0 n. n=O ll.

The reader is no doubt familiar with sketch-graphs of basic functions such a.-. f(x) = x 2 , g(x) = 1 - l/x and h(x) = sinx (see Figure 5.1). Underlying the sketching of these graphs is the plausible assumption that, except for points where the function is undefined, the graphs consist of smooth unbroken curves. This is frequently taken for granted, but can it be justified? In Section 5.2 a precise definition of a continuous function wi11 be given. The formulation given is expressed in terms of the concept of the limit of a function; this is covered in Section 5.1. The advantage of having a fonnal definition of a continuous function is that it is then possible to prove that graphs such as those in Figure 5.1 do consist of 'continuous curves'. In addition, the rules established in Section 5. 2 can be used to construct new continuous functions from more basic ones. This results in quite complicated functions that, by virtue of the fact that they are con- tinuous in the sense of the formal definition, are guaranteed to have graphs consisting of 'continuous curve:;' in the intuitive sense. Firm evidence that the mathematically precise definition of continuity adopted does accord well with intuitive geometrical ideas is given in Section 5.3. In this section several fundamental properties possessed by all continuous functions are proved. The theorems themselves are of independent interest, since they form part of the theoretical basis for Ill 132 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS I (a) /(x) = x2 (b) g(x) = 1 - ~ F\"igureS.1 (c) h(x) = situ many of the practical applications of numerical analysis; a subject con- cerned with the development of efficient algorithms for solving a wide range of mathematical problems. In particular, the intermediate value property (5.3.2) leads directly to the bisection method for locating roots of a real polynomial (see Question 1 of Exercises S.3). The intermediate value property was first formulated and proved by Bolzano (1781-1848), one of the founders of modern analysis. 5.1 Limits The first task in this section is to extend the idea of the limit of a converg- ent sequence in order to analyse the behaviour of a function f: A - R whose domain A contains arbitrarily large positive real numbers x. First note that a sequence (a,.) may be regarded as a function f: N - R, with domain~. given by the formula f(n) ==an. The graph of such a function consists of an infinite number of isolated points, as indicated in Figures 3.1 and 3.3. Hence in Chapter 3 the behaviour of f(n) was investigated for increasingly large positive integral values of n. In contrast, the func- tions graphed in Figure 5.1 have domains that include an interval of real numbers of the form [a, oo) and whose graphs are (or appear to be) unbroken curves. As x increases through real values, the behaviour of these three functions is very reminiscent of the behaviour of sequences as n tends to infinity through integral values. This similarity is examined in the following example. •• EXAMPLEl Figure 5. l(a) gives the graph of the function f: IR- IR where f(x) = x 2 ; as x increases, the graph rises more and more steeply and the values f(x) become larger and larger. 5.1 LIMITS Ill Figure 5.l(b) gives the graph of the function g: t~ t - ~ where g(x) = 1 - 1/x; as x increases, the graph rises but the values g(x) always remain less than one. Figure 5.l(c) gives the graph of the function h: [~- M where h ( x) =-\"' sin x; as .x increases, the graph oscillates between the values ±1. If the domains of f, g and h are restricted to the set ~'\\I of natural numbers then the resulting sequences are respectively di- vergent (to infinity), convergent to 1 and divergent (though bounded). • It is now tempting, for example, to write J - 1/x -1 as x - oc to describe the behaviom; of the function g as x increases. Since x is now a real variable, this will be permissible once the following formal definition has been made. 5.1.1 Definition Let f: A - ~ be a function whose domain A contains the in- te.rval [a, cc) for some fixed real value of a. Then f(x) tends to I. a.~ x tends to infinity, if for every E > 0 there exists a real number X such that x > X => l/(.t) - L < f:. This is denoted by limx--.,., f(x) =I. or f(x)- Las x- oo, •• EXAMPLE2 Prove that limx >\"\" (1 - l / .x) '\"\" l. Solution For positive x Let X = 1./c:. Then x > X implies that In other words, 1 - I/x -1 as x - oo. • If the domain of f contains an interval of the form (- oo, b] for some h E IR then its 'mirror image' g given by g(x) = f(-x) contains the in- terval [b, oo). Sec Figure 5.2. Then f(x) tends to L as .x tends to minus 134 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS l<'igure5.2 infinity if and only if g(x)=f(-x)-L as x-oo. This is denoted by limx-- .. f(x) = Lor f(x)- Las x- -oo. Having extended the language of limits to analyse the behaviour of a function f: A- IR of a real variable x as x takes increasingly large posi- tive or large negative values, it is now natural lo focus attention on the function values f(x) for x close to a fixed real number a. To this end, assume that .f(x) is defined for all real values of x close to a, but not necessarily at a. In other wordi;, assume that the domain off contains the set (a - <5, a) U (a, a + <5) for some 6 > 0. The reason for excluding x = o. is that it is the hehaviour of f(x) as x tends to a that is required, and not the particular value of /(x) at x =a. Indeed, as the following example demonstrates, f (x) may tend to a limiting value as x tends to a, even though f(a) is undefined. • • EXA.i\\11PLE 3 Let f(x) = sinx x a function defined only for x -:# 0. Calculation gives /(0.1) = 0.99833417 f(0.01) = 0.99998333 f(0.001) = 0.999 999 83 It is the case that, as x - 0, (sin x )/x--+ 1 (see Example 3, Section 6.2), even though f(O) is undefined. • Hence in the. definition of the limiting value of f(x) as x tends to a care must be taken to exclude x =a when x tends to a. Now the condi- 5.l LIMITS 135 a-,; a a-.) a-b a a-+.c) 0<1x-al<c5 Figure5.3 lion ix - al< b describes all x in the interval (a - o, a+£>), called a neighbourhood of a. To exclude x :: a, it must be written that 0 <Ix - a1 < D, and this describes the deleted neighbourhood (a - o, a) U (a, a+ h) of a. See Figure 5.3. Let f: A- IR be a function whose domain contains a deleted neigh- bourhood of a. 5.1.2 Definition f (x) tends to the limit L as x tends to a if and only if for every t: > 0 there exists a D > 0 such that 0 < Ix - a' < 6 => lf(x) - f,I < s This is denoted by lim.r-.a f(x) ,..., L or f(x) - L as x - a. If for some given function f it is required to prove that f(x )- L as x--\" a then for each positive s, however small, a b > 0 (depending on l') must be produced such that f (x) is within a distance s of L for all x within a distance <5 of a (excluding x =a, of course). In Figure 5.4 the points of the graph lying in the horizontal strip from y = L - E to y == L + s all satisfy lf(x) - L < s.

In other words, there is a c5> 0 such that Ix - al< c5 forces lf(x) - LI< E. •• EXAMPLE4 Prove that limx--.2 (3x - 1) = 5. Solution What is required is that for every E > 0 there can be found a o > 0 such that 0 <Ix - 2j < 1'-? j(3x - 1) - 51 < 1: But l(3x - 1) - 51 < E is equivalent to l3x - 6i < e, which can be rewritten as Ix - 2! < ~t:.

It is not always so straightforward, as the following two examples illustrate. •• EXAMPLES Prove that lim.r_,3 (x 2) = 9 Solution What is required is that for every e > 0 there can be found a t5 > 0 such that 0 < !x - 31 < {) ~ lx2 - 91 < E Now lx 2 - 91 <Eis equivalent to l(x + 3)(x - 3)1 < e, which can be rewritten as Ix+ 31 Ix - 31 < e.

A far better approach is to derive rules that can be used tn evaluate such limits more easily. Application of these rules v.111 require knowledge of the limits nf certain simple functions - limits that mm;t he verified by appealing to Definition 5.1.1. The definition will of course be instrumental in proving the rules. 5.1.3 Rules Suppose that limx-+a f(x) = L and limx-..i g(x) = M. Then the following rules apply.

If x is allowed to tend to a while x >a throughout then the right-hand limit, limx-+a~ f(x) is obtained.

This has the obvious 1-:-'5 definition. These definitions reveal the following result. 5.1.6 Theorem Jim f(x) = I.<;;> lim f(x) = lim f(x) = lj X-1'/l- •• EXAMPLE IO Consider .f(x) = x 1- Since lim Ix; = lim x = 0 x->01 X-+ll+ and lim lxl = lim (-x) = 0 x-->U- x--.()- it can be deduced that lim .. _.0 '.x I = 0. • •• EXAMPLE 11 If x is a real number then there exists an integer n such that x - 1 < n -'°~ x; n is called the integer part of x and is denoted by [x].

II( is continuous if its graph is a continuous curve. In particular, if the domain of f contains a neighbourhood of a fixed real number c then the graph of f can be drawn through the point (c,f(c)) without removing the pen from the paper. The desired behaviour at (c,f(c)) can he arranged by insisting that, for all values of x sufficiently close to c, f(x) is close to f(c). Before giving the official definition of continuity at x = c, it is helpful to look at the graphs of a few functions. 5.2 \\ I FigureS.7 CONTINUITY ,/ f 2(x) ,-.. t-[x) \\__ l f,(x) = - x 145 •• EXAMPLE 1 Refer to Figure 5.7. (1) f 1(x) = x 2 appears to be a continuous curve for all x. (2) h(x) = x - [x] has finite jumps at integer values of x. (3) h(x) =(sin x)/x, f 4(x) =sin (1/x) and fs(x) = 1/x (x * 0) are all undefined at x = O; however, they exhibit completely differ- ent sorts of behaviour near x = 0. • If f: A-+~ is a function whose domain contains a neighbourhood of c then the following definition is made. 5.2.1 Definition f is continuous at c if and only if limHc f(x) = f(c). Note that this definition demands three things; first that limx-+c f(x) ex- ists, secondly that f(c) is defined, and finally that the previous two values 146 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS are equal. Look at the functions in Example 1 and think about these three requirement'!> as x - 0. Our E-0 definition of lim:r-a f(x) = L (5.1.2) can easily be adapted to give the following 1::-ti definition of continuity at c. 5.2.2 Definition f is continuous at c if and only if for every c > 0 there exists a 6 > 0 such that x - cl< D ~ IJ(x) - f(c) < E •• EXAMPLE2 Use the t: · · /j definition of continuity to prove that f(x) = x 2 is continuous at c = 0.

In other words. Jim, .. o f(x)-== 0, and, since .f(O) = 0, limx--.o f(x) = f(O). Hence f is continuous at 0. • If a function f is continuous for all x in the range a < x < b then it can be said that f is continuous on the interval (a, b). If .f is continuous for all x in its domain, it can be simply said that f is continuous. If lim.H::+ f(x) exists and equals .flc:) then f is called right-continuous at c, and if lim,_--.c f(x) exists and equals .f(c:) then f is called left-l·tmtinuous at c. The s-(j formulations of the last two definitions arc not difficult to write down. Moreover, the following result holds. 5.2.3 Theorem A function f is continuous at c if and only if f is both left-con- tinuous and right-continuou.<, at c Note If a function f is only defined on the clu~cd interval [a, b I and it is claimed that f is ·continuum; on [a, b]', what is meant is that f is continuous OTI (a, b), right-continuous at a and left-contiTiuous at b. Soon, rules that enable the building up of complicated continuous 5.2 CONTINUITY 147 functions from a given list of standard continuous functions such as sine, cosine, exponential and so on will be established. That these standard functions are indeed continuous follows from their power series defini- tions and the fact that the sum function of a power series is continuous for x inside the interval of convergence of the defining power series. See the Appendix. Returping to Example 1, the following comment applies to the discon- tinuities observed there. The following example distinguishes between a discontinuity, where a function is defined but is not continuous, and a singularity, where a function is undefined. •• EXAMPLE 1 (Re,visited) (1) /J(x) = (sinx)/x for x * 0 has what is called a removable singularity at x = 0, since, defining further [3(0) = l, the new h is continuous not only for x * 0 but also at x = 0. (2) The discontinuities of fz(x) = x - [x] are called jump discon- tinuities. This is because the left· and right-hand limits of hat integer values of x exist but are unequal. In fact, '2 is right· continuous but not left-continuous at integer values of x. (3) / 4(x) =sin (1/x), x #\" 0 has an oscillating singularity at x = 0. The oscillations are bounded. (4) / 5(x) = 1/x for x '* 0 exhibits what is termed an inf'mite singu· larity at x = 0. Neither / 4 nor fs can be extended to give functions continuous on the whole of R. • • • EXA.'l\\1PLE 3 Dirichlet's function is defined by f(x) -{: if x = .!!.... is a rational in its lowest form q if x is irrational Restricting our attention to the interval (0, 1), and starting to con· struct the rather bizarre graph of Figure 5.8 gives the following: f(x) = ~ f(x) = ~ f(x) = l f(x) = ! when x = ~ when x = 1 or 2 J ~ when x =!or~ when x = } or ~ or ~ or ~ 148 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS t J. • 0 • ... . ·• ... , • • • .. • Figure5.8 • • • • • • • and so on.

For any c, 0 < c < 1, there exists a lJ > 0 such that the interval ( c - ~. c + 6) contains none of the finitely many x satisfying /(x) ~ 1/q (apart possibly from x = c itself). Hence l/(x)I = f(x) < .!:._ < E q for all x satisfying 0 < 1x - cl < ~. Thus limx-+c f(x) = 0 for all c E {O, 1). So f is continuous at every irrational and discontinuous at every rational in (0, 1)! • 5.2.4 Rules Sum rule If f and g are continuous at c then f + g is continuous at c. Product rule If f and g are continuous at c then f · g is continuous at c. Reciprocal rule If f is continuous at c and f(c) =I= 0 then 1// is continuous at c. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859) was principally in- terested in number theory, and his name arises in connection with many area.c; of both pure and applied mathematics. His main interest in analysis was in its applications to physical problems and number theory. As early as 1837, Dirichlet suggested a very broad definition of a function, not dissimilar to that presented in Chapter 1.3. To S.2 CONTINUITY 149 illustrate the generality of this definition and to exhibit very 'badly behaved' functions, he invented functions such as that in Example 3. The proofs of the above rules and of the following sandwich rule are left as exercises. They all follow immediately from the corresponding rules for limits of functions and the definition of continuity (see 5.1.3, 5.1.4 and 5.2.1). 5.2.5 Sandwich rule Let/, g and h be functions such that h(x) ~ f(x) ~ g(x) for all x in some neighbourhood of c and such that h(c) = f(c) = g(c). If hand g arc continuous at c then so is f. 5.2.6 Composite rule Let f and g be contmuous at c and /le) respectively, such that the composite g o f is defined. Then g o f is continuous at c. Proof of the composite rule Let f ( c) = d. Since g i~ continuous at d, for every £ > 0 there exists a 151 > 0 such that It - di < b1 => lgU) - g(d); < t: (1) Since f is continuous at c and 61 > 0, there exists a ~ > 0 such that Ix - cl < ~ ~ lf(x) - f(c)I < b1 Now let t == f(x) in (1) to deduce that Ix - cl < Oz~ lglf(x)) - g(f(c))I < £ Hence for any i: > 0 there exists a()= O;i > U such that !x - cl<()=:> l(g o f)(x) - (go f)(c)I < c n So far, an arbitrary function has been denoted as f: A ~ R where A is the domain of f. For particular functions, f(x) has been additionally specified for x E A. Whenever the domain off is clear from the context, the alternative notation x • ·> f(x) will often be used. •• EXAMPLE4 Given that the identity function x >--'-\" x, the constant func- tions x ~ k and the trigonometric functions sine and cosini.: arc all ISO CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS continuous (on R), the following are proved to be continuous func- tions.

By the product rule, x 1-+ x 2 and x 1-+ 2x are continuous. Hence x 1-+ x 2 + 2x - 3 and x 1-+ x 2 + x + 1 are continuous by the sum rule. Now x 2 + x + 1 = (x + !)2 + i > 0 for all x and so, by the reciprocal rule, 1 Xl-+---- x2 + x + 1 is continuous. Finally, the product rule shows that x 2 + 2x - 3 x I-+ x 2 + x + 1 is continuous . . (b) The functions x 1-+ x 2 and x 1-+ x 3 are continuous by the pro- duct rule. By the composite rule (5.2.6), x 1-+ cos x 2 is contin- uous. Hence, by the produ'-1 rule, x 1-+ x 3 cosx 2 is continuous. (c) Call the given function /. For x * 0, x 1---> l/x is continuous by the reciprocal rule. So, from the composite and product rules, x •··> x sin (1/x) is continuous for x ::#= 0. In other words, f is continuous for x * 0. At x = 0 the sandwich rule (5.2.5) must be used. Since limx-.o lxl = 0 by Example 10 of Section 5.1, the function x 1-+ Ix I is continuous at x = 0. By the product rule, x >-> -Ix! is also continuous at x = 0. I .ct g(x) = Ix I and h(x) = -lxl. Now h(x),,;;; f(x) ~ g(x) for all x, and h and g are continuous at 0. Hence, by the sandwich rule, f is also continuous at x = 0. • Remark A rational function is one of the form x 1-+ P(x)/Q(x) where P(x) and Q(x) arc both polynomials in x. Such a function is only de- fined for those x for which the denominator Q(x) ::#= 0. Now P and Q are polynomials that are everywhere continuous, from liberal 5.2 CONTINUITY 151 use of the sum and product rules. Also, 1/Q(x) is continuous for those x for which Q(x) * 0, by the reciprocal rule. Hence, by the product rule, every rational function is continuous on its domain. Example 4(a) is just a special case. Recall that a function .f: A - B where A and B are intervals is a hijecdoa if, for every b E 8, there exists a unique a e A with f(a) = b. In this case the inverse function r 1: B - A, given by 1-1 (b) =a, is de- fined. If f: A- B is either stricl.ly increasing, in which case for all al> a2 t A, a1 > az =:- f(a1) > /(02) or strictly decreasing, in which case ;. for all all a2 E A, a1 > a2 -= f(a1) < f(a2) and Bis the image of I. then f will be a bijection. (Why?) The next rule enables us to increase our fund of known continuous functions. 5.2. 7 Inverse rule Suppose that I: A - B is a bijection where A and B are in- tervals. If f is continuous on A then 1-1 is continuous on B. This result can be proved at the end of Section 5.3, since for the proof the interval theorem (5.3.3) must be invoked. The next example assumes that the sine and exponential functions are continuous. By suitably restricting the domains and codomains of these functions, continuous bijections can be derived whose inverses arc thus continuous. •• EXAMPLES Each of the functions in Table 5.1 is a continuous bijection, and so by the inverse rule has the spct..ificd continuous inverse. Note that h is clearly strictly increasing on its domain. Example 2 of Section 6.2 shows that g is strictly increasing on IR, and the Appendix shows that f is strictly increasing on [-!11', !11']. • It is now possible to prove the composite rule for sequences (3.1.4) and the composite rule for limits (5.1.5).

The results arc also of independent interest, since some of them form the theoretical basis of useful techniques in numerical analysis. The statement of each theorem will he accompanied by a graph and a brief commentary intended to give a 'feel' for the result. The proofs are naturally rigorous 154 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS and bring into play the underlying properties of the real number system !R. Of particular importance will be the completeness axiom (2.2.3). 5.3.1 The boundedness property Let f be continuous on the interval [a, b]. Then (1) f is bounded on [a, b], (2) f attains both a maximum value and a minimum value somewhere on I a, h J. Commentary Part (1) of this result claims that there exist real numbers m and M such that m ~ f(x) '!S; M for all x E [a, b]. Part (2) makes the stronger claim that f attains both a maximum value and a mini- mum value on [a, b]; in other words, that there exist c and din [a, b J such that f(c) ~ f(x) o5; f(d) for all x E [a, b ]. See Figure 5. 9. Proof <if the houndedne~·s propert)' The proof is in three parts. Preliminary observation The proof of (1) requires the key observation that if a function f is continuous at c then f is hounded on an interval of the form (c - b, c + J) for some o > 0. This can be deduced from the E-D definition of continuity (5.2.2), which states that for every F. > 0 there exists a b>O such that lx-cl<o=>lf(x)-/(c)l<e, by letting C' = 1 (other values of F. could equally well be chosen).

This argument can easily be adapted to show that, since .f is right-continuous at a, f is bounded on an interval of the fonn [a, a+ 6') for some o' > 0. Proof of(l) Let B = {x: x e [a, bJ and f is bounded on [a, x]}, with the aim of proving that B =.-!a, hJ. First, a ER, and so Bis a non-empty set of real numbers; secondly, B is bounded above by b. So, by the completeness axiom (2.2.3), B possesses a least upper bound. Let c =sup B be this least upper bound. All that is now required is to show that c = b. Since f is right-continuous at a, f is bounded on [a, a+ o') for some {/ > 0, and so f is bounded on [a, a+ !<5']. Hence c ~ a + ~ i5' > a. Suppose by way of contradiction that c < b. Since c > a, f is continuous at c, and so f is bounded on ( c - '5, c + ~) for some (j > 0. From the definition of c, f is bounded on [a, c - <5]. Hence f is in fact bounded on [a, c + 6) and, since fJ > 0, f is bounded on [a, c + ~ 6]. Hence c + ~ () e B, contradicting the fact that c is the supremum of B. Therefore c = b. All that is now required is to show that b e B. Since f is left- continuous at b, f is bounded on ( b - {J*, b] for some {J*, where 0 < c5* < h - a. But b =sup B, and so f is bounded on fa, d] for any d, 6 - {J* < d < b. For such a d, f is also bounded on [d, b], and so f is bounded on [a, b ], as required. This establishes (1). Proof o/(2) Let A = f([a, b]) = {f(x): a~ x ~ b }. Since f is bounded on [a, b], A is bounded both above and below. Let m =inf A and M = sup A. What is now required is to show that m and M are both values of the function f. To this end, suppose by way of contradiction that there is no value of x for which f (x) = M. De- fine a new function g by 1 g(x)\"\" M - f(x) for x E [a, bj; g is defined on [a, b] and continuous on [a, b] by the sum, product and reciprocal rules (5.2.4). Hence, by part (1), g is also bounded on [a, bj. In particular, there exists a real number 156 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS K > 0 such that g(x) ~ K for all x e [a, bJ. But 1 g(x) ~ K => M - f(x),,.:; K 1 ~K :.s; M - f(x) 1 ~f(x)~M- K This contradicts the fact that M is the least upper bound for f on [a, b J, so the assumption that M is not a value off is false. Hence f attains a maximum value somewhere on [a, b]. A similar argument shows that f attains a minimum value somewhere on [a, b). n 5.3.2 The intermediate value property Let f be continuous on the interval [a, b J and suppose that f(a) =a and f(b) = {3. For every real number y between er and {3 there exists a number c, a < c < b, with f ( c) = y. Ct1mmentary This result claims that if a continuous function f takes the values a and fi at the endpoints of some interval {a, b] then f must take all possible values between a and {3. See Figure 5.10, where it has been assumed that a< p, and so a< y < {J. Proof of the internuuliate value property The result will be proved when a < b and a< y < fi, the cor· responding proofs in other cases being similar. The essence of the a (' Figure5.10 5.3 THEOREMS 157 proof is to consider the set of xs for which f(x) is strictly less than y and show that if c is the suprcmum of this set then f(c) = y. So, let S =- {x: x e [a, b] and f(x) < :1}, where a< y < f1 The set S is non-empty, since it contains a, and it is bounded above by b. Hence, by the completeness axiom (2.2.3), S posses- ses a least upper bound. Let c =sup S. Then a'-\"~ c ~= b. In fact, the condition a< c < b holds true. To see why this is the case, note that, since f is left-continuous at a, for E = y - er> 0 there exists a 6 > U such that 0 ~ x - \"< (5 =- lf(x) - f(a)I < l: • In particular, l/(a + !c5) - /(u)I < 1-:, and so f(a + !6) - f(a)<y-rr. Since f(a)=a, this gives f(a+~6)<y, and so u + ~c5 e S. This means that a< c:. To establish that c < b, let E =- {J- y > 0. Then the right-con- tinuity off alb guarantees that then.: exists a <5 > 0 such that -c5 < x - b ~ 0 => lf(x) - f(b) < e In particular, lf(b - i6) - f(h)I < e, and so f(b) - f(b - !a)< {1- y. Since f(b) = fi, this gi~·es f(b - !a)> y, and sob - !c> $ S. This means that c < b. Since a< c < b, f is continuous at c, a fact that is now usi..:d to show that the possibilities (i) f(c) < y and (ii) f(c) > i' are both impossible. Case (i) If f(c) < y then t: = y - f(c) > 0. Since f is continuous at c, there exists a c5 > 0 such that Ix - cl< o ~ lf(x) - /(c)I < E Choose c5 such that CJ.< max (c - a, b - c), so that the conr.Iition Ix - c < 6 guarantees that x e I a, b], the interval under considera- tion. Then, in particular, :f(c + ~6) - f(c) < E and so f(c + !o) - f(c) < y - f(c) 158 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS But then f(c + ~c5) < y, and hence c + !iS e S, which contradicts the fact that c is the suprcmum of S. Hence f(c) < y is impossible. Case (ii) If f(c) > y then 1-: = f(c)- y > 0. Since f is continuous at c:, there exists a 6 > 0 such that ix - el< <5 ~ lf(x) - f(c)! < e Again, choose c5 such that b<max(c - a, b- c). Therefore, for any x satisfying c - b < x ~ e, lf(x) - f(c)! < f(c) - y and so f(x) > y. Hence, none of the xs in the range c - c5 < x ~ c lie in S. which contradicts the fact that c is the supremum of S. Hence /(c) > y is impossible. Therefore the only conclusion that can be drawn is that f(c) = y, and soy is a value off, as required. 0 The intermediate value property has many applications, and Example J illustrates one of these. Howeyer, one immediate consequence follo\\\\'S if the result is applied to the continuous function x ~ x 2 on the interval [1, 2). Since x 1--+ x 2 takes the value 1 at the left-hand endpoint of [l, 2) and the value 4 at the right-)iand endpoint, and 1<2 < 4, there exists a real number between 1 and 2 such that x 2 = 2. This establishes the exist- ence of v'2 in a far less painful manner than that presented in Section 2.3. By considering the continuous function x ~ x\" where n is a positive integer, the intermediate value property can be used, in a similar vein, to deduce that every positive real number a has a positive nth root. •• EXAMPLE! Any polynomial of odd degree has at least one real root. SolutWn Let P(x) = ao + aix + ... + anxn, where n is odd, and without loss of generality let a\" :-:: 1. We know that Pis continuous.

In particular, l+r(x)>O for lxl > 1 + M. Hence P(x) = x\"[l + r(x)] has the same sign as x\" for Ix I > 1 + M. Since n is odd, there exist a, fJ E IR with P( a:') > 0 (choose £r>l+M.) and P(/~)<0 (choose {:J<-(l+M.)). By 5.3.2, P(y) =0 for some ~1, IYI < 1 + M. Incidentally, this shows that P has a zero in the interval (-(1 + M), I + M). In fact, all the real zeros of P lie in this interval. • An immediate consequence of 5.3.1and5.3.2 is the following result. 5.3.3 The interval theorem Let f be continuous on J =[.a, b]. Then f(J) is a closed bounded interval. Commentary The claim here is that continuous functions map intervals onto intervals. This means that the intuitive picture of a continuous function as one having a continuous graph is sound. See Figure 5.11. Proof of the interval theorem By the boundedness property (5.3.1), there exist numbers c and d in J such that f(c)--= m and f(d) = M and m ~ f(x) ,.,; M for all 160 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS /(J) I m ~--------~-------~---- ' I u d c J Jo'lgureS.11 b x e J.

Commentary This result says that on proceeding continuously from (0, f\"(O)) to (1, /(1)) then the line y = x must be crossed. See Figure 5.12. y=x FlgureS.12 5.3 THEOREMS 161 Proof of the fixed poillt theorem I .ct g: [O, 1]--+ IR he defined by g(x) = f(x) - x. Since the identity function x ~ x is continuous, the sum and product rules (5.2.4) can be applied to deduce that g is continuous on [O, 1]. If f(O) = 0 or f(l) = 1 then there is nothing to prove. So it is assumed that /(0) * 0 and /(1) * 1. Since f maps onto [O, l], g(O) > 0 and g(l) < 0. The intermediate value property (5.3.2) applied tog on the interval [U,l] implies that g(c)-0 for some c, O<c<l. Hence f(c) = c fi Hcforc proving the inverse rule (5.2.7) whose proof has hcen delayed since the interval theorem is required, some examples will be given to demonstrate that if tha hypotheses of the theorems in this section are violated, the conclusions will not hold. •• EXAMPLE2 (1) The function f(x) = l/x is continuou~ on the open interval (0, l), but it is not bounded on (0, 1). Hence the boundedness property holds only for functions continuous on closed inter· vals. (2) The function f (x) ,,.,. x - [ x l is not continuous on the interval [O, 2]. It is bounded on [O, 2], but it does not possess a maxi- mum value on [O, 21. (3) Consider the function {-2 f(x) = - 2 if x < 0 if x ~ 0 Now f is not continuous on the interval [-1, 1). Although f(-1).,.,. -2 and /(1) - 2, f does not take any of the values betwcen-2and2ontheinterval[-1,l}. - • Proof o.f 5.2.7 Consider the continuous bijection f: A___.,.. B where A and B arc intervals. First it is shown that f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. If f is neither strictly increasing nor decreasing then, without loss of generality, there are numbers a 1 , a2 and a3 such that a1 < a2 < a3 and f(a1) < f(a3) < f(a2)· Apply the inter- mediate value theorem (5.3.2) to f on the interval lai. a2 1 to de- duce that f(c) = f(a 3) for some cc (a 1, a2). This contradicts the fact that f is a bijection. For the rest of the proof it is assumed that f is strictly increasing, the proof for the strictly decreasing case being similar. 162 CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS By Question 5 of Exercises 5.2, 1-1 is strictly increasing. Let b e B, where b is not equal to either of the endpoints of the interval B, and suppose that /- 1(b) =a, so that /(a)= b. For every E > 0 such that a± E lies in the interval A, f maps the interval J =[a - I:', a+ 1-:] onto some interval f(J) = lm, M] by the interval theorem (5.3.3). Since f is strictly increasing, m < b < M, so let c be the minimum of b - m and M - b. Clearly /> > 0. Now [h - c5, b + ~) is a subset of [m, M] = f(J), and so r 1 maps (b - o, b + o] into J =[a - f., a+ e]. Thus, given any E > 0, there exists a {J > 0 such that This shows that at all points of B, except the endpoints, 1-1 : 8-+A is continuous. Minor changes are required in the above proof to establish the one-sided continuity claimed for the endpoints of B. Hence .r-1 : B-+ A is continuous on B, as required. n Exercises 5.3 1.

CHAPTER SIX Differentiation 6.1 Differentiable functions 6.2 Theorems 6 6.3 Taylor polynomials 6.4 Alternative forms of Taylor's theorem Differentiation originated in thc problem of drawing tangents to {smooth) curves and in finding the maximum and minimum values of functions. Although the Greeks were concerned with such problems, and indeed invented some very cunning methods for their solution, it was not until the seventeenth century that new methods were developed that, in turn, led to the discovery of differential calculus. The English scientist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), one of the greatest mathe- maticians the world has yet produced, invented the differential calculus in 1666 and recorded iL in his Method of Nuxions in 1671. However, this work was not published until 1736, by \\Vhich time the German mathcmati- cian Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 ·1716) had discovered differential calculus independently and published his findings in 1684. Thcir dis- coveries had a profound effect on the mathematical community, and by 1700 calculus formed part of the undergraduate curriculum. Applications of calculus were pursued with, as has been previously mentioned, little n.:gard for its logical foundations. This came later and is, as is the cas1.: in this chaptcr, based firmly on the theory of limits. The account begins in Section 6.1. where the geometric concept of a tangent line to a graph is formalized as a limit whose value (if it exists) gives the slope of the tangent line. The. standard rules for differentiation are established, which. together with the limit definition of differentiabil- ity, show that the class of differentiable functions includes polynomials, 165 166 DIFFERENTIATION trigonometric functions, the exponential function and combinations of these elementary functions. Section 6.2 discusses the properties of functions differentiable on an interval and proves some powerful results about dcri••atives, many of which can be described easily in geometric terms. Some applications of these theorems are given, including the use of calculus in establish- ing inequalities between functions and in evaluating limits of the form limx--+u [f(x)/g(x)] in the awkward case where J(a) = g(a) = 0. Power series expansions of functions form the substance of Section 6.3, where it is shown that, under suitable restrictions, certain polyno- mials, known as Taylor polynomials, can be used to approximate the '\\lalues of a given function. Moreover, a precise estimate is given for the accuracy of such approximations, a subject pursued further in Section 6.4. Tiie application of differential calculus to the problem of finding the maximum and minimum values of a function is a recurring theme throughout this chapter. An early result, in Section 6.1, establishes the fact that local maxima and minima of differentiable functions occur only at points where the derivative is zero. The increasing-decreasing theorem in Section 6.2 shows how the sign of the derivative aids the problem of determining local extrema. Finally, in Section 6.3, Taylor series expan- sions are used to obtain a classification theorem for local extrema. 6.1 Differentiable functions Intuitively, a function f: A__,,, IR is differentiable at c E A if a tangent can be drawn to the curve at the point P = (c,f(c)). The slope of the chord PQ in Figure 6. I is f(x) - f(c) x-c and, as Q moves closer to P, it is required that the slope of PQ approach the slope of the tangent line at P. This geometric idea motivates the following formal definition. 6.1.1 Definition A function f: A - ~is differentiable at c if and only if l . f(x) - f(c) 1m~--- x-c x - (.' exists. The value of thi~ limit, called the derh-·ath·e off at c, is denoted by f' ( c). 6.1 DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS 167 y=f(x) Figure6.l An alternative form of the limit in 6.1.1 is obtained by setting x = c + h. Then lim f(x) - f(c) = lim f(c + h) - .f(c) it~C X-C h->0 h Either form may be used. •• EXAMPLE I The function /(x) = x 2 is differentiable for all x. Solution Consider /(x) - f(c) x-c for any x =fo c where c is fixed. Now f(x) - f(c) x 2 - c2 Jim = lim - - = lim (x + c) = 2c x ..... c X - C A\"-+C X - C .t ..... C Hence f is differentiable al c: and f'(c) = 2c. Since c: was arbitrary, the derived function f' can be defined by f' (x} = 2x. • •• EXAMPLE2 The function f(x) = Ix i is not differentiable at c = 0. 168 DIFFERENTIATION Solution Consider f(x) - f(O) _ ixl. _ f 1 x - 0 - x ·- l-1 Hence lim f(x) - /(O) = 1 x~o+ x - 0 but lim f(x) - f(O) == -l .Y-0- X - 0 if x > 0 if x < 0 and, since these right- and left-hand limi~ differ, f is not differen- tiable at 0. It is easy to show that f is differentiable for all x * 0. The graphs of f and its derived function are shown in Figure 6.2, where it is geometrically obvious that a tangent line cannot be drawn at the origin. • Points on the graph of a function f where f is not differentiable can often be detected by examining the left- and right-hand limits of j(x) - f(c) x - c as x- c. The limit l. f(x) - [(<:) Im - x-r- X - C /(:rt)=lx1 Figurc6.2 f'(x) = { I x > 0 -1 .x<O 6.1 DIFFERENTIABLE FUNCTIONS 169 is called the left-hand derivative of f at c: and i~ denoted by f'_(c). Similarly. lim f(x) - f(c) .r >1.- x - c is called the right-hand derivative of .f at c and is denoted by f~(c). Clearly f'(c) exists if and only if f'-(c) and /'._(c) both exist and are equal. The next rc:mlt establishes the fact that only continuum; func..1ions can he differentiable. 6.1.2 Theorem If f is differentiable at c then f is continuous at '-.. Proof Define the function F,, by . { f(x) - f(c) fc(x) = x - c f'(c) if x 4= (.' if x = c: Therefore the function Fe gives the slope of the chord PQ in Figure 6.1 for Pt= Q and the slope of the tangent line when Q = P.

Since x 1-+ sin x is differentiable for all x, xi-+ tan x is dif- ferentiable for the specified x by the quotient rule. The derivatives of the three functions are given by x i-+ 2x + cos x, x 1-+ 2x sin x + x 2 cos x and x ~ sec 2 x respectively. • 6.1.5 Sandwich rule Let f; g and h be three functions such that g(x) ~ f(x) ~ h(x) for all x in some neighbourhood of c and such that g(c) = f(c) = h(c).

He entered the diplomatic service, to which he devoted 40 years of his life. This proved to be a lucrative employ- ment that left Leibniz plenty of time to pursue his interests; these were diverse, and he produced scholarly work in Sanskrit, philo- sophy and mathematics. Leibniz had a keen appreciation of the importance of logical reasoning and of the need for an appropriate language and notation in any new subject. It was he who, on 29 October 1675, first used the sign f for integration; derived from the first letter of the Latin word summa, meaning sum. By the time his paper on differential calculus appeared in 1684, Leibniz was writing differentials as we do today. Many of the standard rules for differen- tation were obtained by Leibniz, and the notation dy/dx is still associated with his name, as is Leibniz' formula (see 6.2.6) for find- ing the nth derivative of a product of two functions. The last seven years of his life were spent in bitter controversy with Newton over who had priority in the discovery of calculus. When, in 1714, Leib- niz' employer became the first Hanoverian king of England, Leibniz was left in Germany to spend his declining years a~ a neglected scholar. Newton, on the other hand, when he died in 1727, was buried with pomp and circumstance in Westminster Abbey. However, the priority dispute itself alienated British mathematicians from their continental counterparts for much of the eighteenth cen- tury, much to the detriment of British mathematics. 6.1.7 Inverse rule Suppose that f: A - B is a bijection where A and B arc in- tervals.

(Why not?) • Chapter 5 showed that the limit definition of a continuous function could be used to establish theorems that supported the intuitive notion that the graph of a continuous function is a 'continuous curve'. The graph of a differentiable function can be dubbed a 'smooth' continuous curve. The theorems to support this idea are developed in the next section, but this section concludes with a result that helps to locate the local maxima and minima of a differentiable function. 6.1.8 Definition A function f has a local maximum value at c if c is contained in some open interval J for which f(x) '6; f(c) for each x e J. If /(x);;.: f(c) for each x e J then f has a local minimum value at c:. See Figure 6.3 for a diagrammatic representation of these two types of local extrema. 6.1.9 Local extremum theorem If f is differentiable at c and possesses a local maximum or a local minimum at c then f'(c) = 0. Proof Consider the case of a local minimum at x = c. There is an open interval J with centre c such that f(x)- f'(c) ;;oO for all x e .T. If J J Local maximum Local minimum Figure6.3 180 DIFFERENTIATION x > c then j(x) - f(c) ;a. 0 x-c and if x < c then f(x) - f(c)_ :si 0 x-c Thus /~(c)~O and f~(c)~O. But f'(c) exists, and so f~(c) = f'_(c). Thus f'(c) = 0. 0 Note that, although .f' must vanish at a local cxtremum, this is not sufficient for such a point. For example, consider the behaviour of f(x) = x 3 at x = 0. Here f' (0) = 0, but (0, 0) is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum. The next example shows that the local extremum theorem together with the boundedness property for continuous functions (see 5.3.l) enables the global maxima and minima of a differentiable function to be determined, since on a closed bounded interval these occur either at points where f' = 0 or at the endpoints of the interval. •• EXAMPLE11 Determine the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = x(x - l)(x - 2) on the interval fO, 3J. Soluticm First investigate the local extrema of f on (0,3J. Since f is a polynomial, it is differentiable on (0, 3]. Moreover, f'(x) = x(2x - 3) + (x - l)(x - 2) = 3x 2 - 6x + 2 which has roots at x = 1 ± 1/ y'i The maximum and minimum values off on (0, 31 lie in the function values f(O), /(1 - 1/VJ), ((1+1/0) and f(3) .. 1:1ence the maximum v~lue off on [Q, 3] IS /(3) = 6, and the minimum value on [O, 3] is /(1+1/ V3)-= -2/3\\13. • 6.2 THEOREMS 181 Exercises 6.1 l.

Calculate f' for each of the functions in Question 4. 6.2 Theorems This section establishes some hasic properties of differentiahlc functions. The main result is the mean value theorem, which will be proved by first establishing a special case of it known as Rolle's thc.:orcm. 182 DIFFERENTIATION 6.2.1 Rolle's theorem Let f he differentiable on (a, h) and continuous on [a, b]. If f( a) = f( b) then there exists a c, a < c < b, such that f'(c) = 0. (See Figure 6.4.) Proof Since J is continuous on ra, b], it attains a maximum value f(c 1) and a minimum value f(c 2) on [a, b] by the boundedness property (5.3.1). If f(c 1) = /(c 2) then f is constant for all x E !a, b], whence f'(x) :::o0 for all x Ela, b], and the result follows. If f(c 1) 1= f(c 2 ) then at least one of c1 and c2 is not at a or b. Hence f has a local maximum or minimum (or both) inside the interval [a, b]. By the local extremum theorem (6.1.9), f' is zero at at least one point inside [a, bj. 0 Although Figure 6.4 seems to imply that Rolle's theorem is obvious, it \"' important to note that the result is true for any differentiable function and not just the idealized one depicted in Figure 6.4. Michel Rolle (1652-1729) was a French mathematician foremost among those who questioned the validity of many of the new infin- itesimal methods derived from the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. Indeed, Rolle attacked the calculus itself as a collection of ingenious fallacies. It was attacks such as these by respected mathematicians that led to attempts to reconcile the new calcului'. with the more ancient geometry of Euclid. This reconciliation concentrated on those (limiting) processes underlying the calculu:;. and developed into the subject now known as mathematical analysis. Although Rolle exposed several absurdities that aro~c from the indiscriminate a c b Figure6.4 6.2 THEOREMS 183 use of calculus, he was eventually convinced of the soundness of the developing analytical approach to the subject. Among several con- tributions to analysis is the theorem that bears his name, published in an obscure book in 1691. Its fundamental importance wa.o; not recognized at the time. since it arose as incidental to methods of finding approximate solutions of equations. 6.2.2 Mean value theorem Let f be differentiable on (a, h) and continuous on [a, b]. Then there cxi~t.., a c, a < c < b, such that { f'(c) _,,, l(l~) - f(a) b-a Proof The result is illustrated in Figure 6.5. For the proof Jct g(x) = f(x) - Ax, where A. is chosen so that g(a) = g(b); that is. A.= f(b) - f(a) b-a the slope of the chord joining (a,f(a)J to (b,.f(h)). Now f is dif- ferentiable on (a. b), a-; is the linear function x ~ -).x. By the sum rule (6.1.3), g is also differentiable on (a, b). Similarly, g is con- tinuous on [a, b]. The choice of A. means that, in addition, g(a) = g(b). Applying Rolle's theorem to g yields a c, a< c: < h, such that g'(c) = 0. Hence f'(c) - A= 0, so that f\"'(c) = f(b) - [(~)_ b - ll [] a c b Figure6.5 184 DIFFERENTIATION An immediate consequence of the mean vaJue theorem is the follow- ing result, which in turn gives a technique for analysing the graphs of differentiable functions. 6.2.3 The increasing-decreasing theorem If f is differentiable on (a, b) and continuous on la, bl then (1) f'(x) > 0 for all x e {a, b) => f is strictly increasing on [a, b]. (2) f'(x) < 0 for all x e (a .• b) ='> f is strictJy decreasing on [a, b). (3) f'(x) = 0 for all x E (a, b) = f is constant on [a, b].

In other words, f is strictly increasing on [a, b]. The proofs of (2) and (3) are similar. 0 •• EXAMPLE! Find and describe the local extrema of f(x) = x 2c -.r. Solution Now f is everywhere differentiable and continuous and f'(x) =-= 2xe-:c - x'-c ·x == e-x(2 - x)x Local extrema occur only when f' (x) = 0, and so x :-:: 0 or x = 2. Since e-xex =ex· x = e 0 = 1, e\" * 0 for all x e ~. Then er> 0 for all x, otherwise the intermediate value property (3.3.2) implies that e vanishes somewhere. Hence if x < 0 then f'(x) < O; if 0 < x < 2 then f'(x)> O; and if x > 2 then f'(x) < 0. Thus f is decreasing on (-oo, OJ, increasing on [0,2J and decreasing again on [2, oo). This means that x = 0 gives a local minimum, and x = 2 gives a local maximum of/. See Figure 6.6. • The use of the increasing-de<--reasing theorem for finding and classify- ing local extrema seen in the previous example will be superseded in the sequel by <-Tisper methods. However, 6.2.3 is extremely useful for estab- lishing inequalities between functions. 6.2 ' \\ Figure6.6 THEOREMS 185 --- •• EXAMPLE2 Prove that er ?-- 1 + x for all x.

Hence there is a c, a< c < b, such that h'(c) = 0. This gives f'(c) = ),g'(c), and the result now follows.

This text contains the rule with which his name is associated. However, the rule was in fact discovered by Jean Bernoulli (1667-1748), one of the dozen or so eminent Swiss mathematicians spilwned by six successive generations of the Bernoulli family during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Bernoulli in- structed the young Marquis in 1692 and, in return for a regular salary, entered into an agreement whereby L'Hopital received Ber- noulli's mathematical discoveries and had permission to do with them as be pleased. The Analyse takes a Leibnizian approach to calculus, covers t\\Je basic rules of differentiation and makes use of them in a wide variety of applications. The author pays due credit to both Leibniz and Bernoulli in bis preface, and there is no doubt that some of the text was developed independently by L'Hopital, a fine mathematician in his own right. •• EXAMPLE3 lim sin~= 1 x.....O X Soluli,on The functions f(x) = sinx and g(x) = x satisfy the hypotheses of L'Hopital's rule.

L'Hopital's rule can be used to evaluate many seemingly indetermin- ate limits once they have been expressed as the limit of a quotient of differentiable functions; provided of course that lim f'(x) .l .... XO g'(X) can be evaluated. Often this final limit is itself indeterminate (in other words f'(x 0) = g'(x 0) = 0), and it may be tempting to apply L'H6pital's rule again. But this requires that f' and g' themselves be differentiable. If the derived function f' of a given differentiable function is itself differen- tiable, it is said that f is twice differentiable, and f\" or t<2> is written for its second derivative. ln general, f is n-times differentiable if f is (n - 1)- timcs differentiable and its (n - l)th derivative is differentiable. lne nth derivative is denoted by /Cnl.

When faced with the probJc.m of evCJluating sin x or ex to a high degree of accuracy, especially when more decimal places are required than an electronic calculator can provide, the situation is not so clear-cut. For the elementary functions, one approach would be to use an nth part fol sum of the power ~ries defining the function, for a sujtably large value of n. This would be a polynomial of degree /1 - 1 whose value at any specified x provides an approximation to the value at x of the elementary function under consideration. However, there ii;, no obvious measure of how accurate such an approximation might be. For other functions there is also the question of whether or not they may be repre- sented by power series. This section provides answers to such questions. ln order to determine the form of those polynomials that may be used to approximate the values of a given function, and ultimately to derive a power series expansion of the function, it is first necessary to examine the coefficients of powers of x in a general power series. Suppose that 2.: ;_.0 a.,x\" is a power series \\vi th radius of convergence R. Let f(x) be the sum of thiis series for ix'.< R. lt is proved in the Appendix that f is differentiable and that J'(x) -= L na71xn- l for lxl < R 1i=l Continually differentiating in this manner leads to .t<'>(x) = 2: n(n - I)(n - 2) · · · (n - r + I)a.,x\" r for lx1 < R 11.-=r If x = 0 then .t<'>(O) a, = --,- · for r -= I , 2, ... r.

It shows that certain functions can then be expressed as the sum of suitable power series. This investigation begins with a definition. 6.3.1 Definition Let f be an n-times continuously differentiable function at 0. The Taylor polynomial of degree n for fat 0 is defined by •• EXAMPLE 1 Let f(x) = e'. Then f<n(x) =ex for r = l, 2, ... , and so f(rl(O) = 1. Thus Tof(x) = 1 Tif(x) = I + x Tzf(x) = l + x + ~x 2 and so on. As can be seen from Figure 6.7, as n increases, the Taylor polynomials become progressively better approximations to f(x) =-:ex near x = 0. • TJ(x) f(x)-= e' Figure6.7 196 DIFFERENTIATION The first result in this section provides an estimate of the difference between f(b), the value of a given function at x = b, and TJ(b), the value of its Taylor polynomial of degree n at x = b. 6.3.2 The first remainder theorem Let f be ( n + 1 )·times continuously differentiable on an open interval containing the points 0 and b. Then the difference between f and T ,J at x = b i:s given by f(h)- T,f(b) == -~ J<n• 1>(c:) (n + l)! for some c between 0 and b. Proof For simplicity, assume that b > 0. Let h 11(x) = f(b) - #o [t<r:~xJ (b - x)'] (x E [O, b]) Then hn(b) == 0 and hn(O) = f(b) - T nf(b). Let g(x) = hnCx) -( b ~ ~r- 1 hn(O) (x e [o, b]) Then g is continuous on (0, bl and differentiable on (0, b), and g(O) = g(b). Hence, by Rollc's theorem (6.2.1), g'(c) = 0 for some c between 0 and b. Now / (11-11)() h 1 (x)-=- x-(b-x)\" \" n! after a straightforward calculation. Thus v'(x)::: - f(n t li(x_2 (b - x)\" + (n + 1)(b - x)~ h (0) 0 nl bn-1 n and so 0 = g'(c) == - 1<n-ll(c) (b - c)\" + (n + 1)(~ - c)\" h (0) n! b\"-1 n leading to l n·• 1 h (0) = 'J f(n-t-l)(c) n (n + 1)! as required. TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS 197 Denote f(b) - TJ(b) by RJ(b) and call it the remainder term at x = h. Thus f(/J) _, T,J'(b) + R,J'(b), and so the error in approximating f(b) by TJ(b) is given by the remainder tenn RJ(b). Since f<11 ·• 1) is continuous on an interval containing 0 and b, it is bounded on that interval. Therefore there exist~ a number M such that ,t<n+lJ(c)° ~ M, and so , hn+l IRJ(b)I ,:; jc; + Dli M Thus, for fixed n, the remainder term will be ~mall for b close to zero. In other words, Taylor polynomials provide good apprmdmations to func- tions near x = 0.

Colin Maclaurin (1698-1746) was a Scotsman who ranks as one of the finest British mathematil.\"ians in the generation after Newton. Although principally interested in geometric curves, he is best known for the series that bears his name. Thc!.c appeared in his Treatise <~f Fluxions in 1742, and had been anticipated by some half dozen earlier workers. In fact, this series is only a special case of the ·more general Taylor series published by Brook Taylor (\"1685-1731) in his 1'1ethodus incrementorum directa et inversa. Taylor, a Cam- bridge graduate, used his series to solve equations numerically by obtaining successively closer and closer approximations. In fact, the general Taylor series expression was known to Jean Hcrnoulli years before it appeared in print in Taylor's Methodus incremmtonmt. History, as usual, is fickle in the matter of attaching names to theorems. 6.3 TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS 199 •• EXAMPLE3 Derive the Maclaurin ~cries for f(x) = c; Solr1lion First, \\\"2 xn T J(x) = 1 + x ..,.. ~2 , + ... + - 1 . n. and ,, ... t R,J(x) =- (~x+ l)! e\" for some c between 0 and x.

A form of Taylor's theorem much used in numerical analysis is de- rived below and used to round off the investigation of local extrema of functions begun in Section 6. I.

Then c lies between a and a + h.

This expression emphasizes that the value of f at a + h is determined by the values of f and its derivatives at a, with (} measuring the degree of indeterminacy. Note that 8 depends on h; it is not a constant that works for all values of h. When the nature of a function f that has a stationary point at x = a (that is, f'(a) = 0) is investigated, it is required that the sign of f(a + h) - f(a) for all small h be examined. The expression in 6.3.6 relates .f(a \"!'\" h) - f(a) to the de1ivatives off at a, thus enabling the following to be proved. 6.3. 7 Classification theorem for local extrema If f' is (n + 1)-timcs continuously differentiable on a neigh- bourhood of a and /Cr>(a) = 0 for r = 1, 2, .. ., n (in particular, f'(a) = 0 and so x =a is a stationary point of /) and J<n·d)(a) =F 0 then (1) n + 1 even and f<11+1>(a)>O=> f has a local minimum at x=a (2) n + 1 even and J<n•1>(a) < 0 ~ f has a local maximum at x=a (3) n + 1 odd => f has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at x == a Prllllf Since t<r>(a) = 0 for ,. = 1, 2, ... , n, hrz f(a + h) = f(a) + lif'(a) -r ... + -fC 11>(a) n! hnll + f(n+ll(a +Oh) (n + 1)! hn+l = f(a) + . f(n+t>(a + Oh) (n + 1)! for some e, 0 < 0 < 1 6.3 TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS 203 Hence hn It f(a + h) - /(a)= J<n~l)(a + Hh) (n + 1)! where 0< 0<1. Since J<n+ 1>(a)\"#O and t<n+t) is continuous, there is a {> > 0 such that t<n-t)(x) * 0 for Ix - al < c5. Thus, for all h satisfying hi< 6, J<n+l>(a +Oh) has the same sign as J<n 11>(a). So f(a + h) - f(a) has the same sign as hn+I J<11+i>(a) for all h, lhl < l>. (1) If n + l is even and /<1111>(a) > 0 then f(a + h)- f(a) > 0 on the open interval (a - 6, a+ 6).

(3) If n + 1 is odd, the sign of /(a+ h) - f(a) changes with the sign of h. It is said that x = a gives a horizontal point of inflec- t~. D •• EXAMPLE4 Determine the nature of the stationary points of f(x) = x 6 - 6x 4 Solution Since f is a polynomial function, it is infinitely differentiable. Now f'(x) = 6x 5 - 24x 3 = 6x 3(x 2 - 4) Thus f has stationary points at x = 0 and at x = ±2. Now f\"(x) = 30x 4 - 72x 2 , and so /\"(±2) = 192 > 0. Thus f has local minima at x = ±2. However, f\"(O) = 0. Since J<3>(x) = 120x 3 - 144x, /<3>(0) = 0. Now [<4>(x) = 360x 2 -144, and so f'4>(o) = -144 <0. Thus f has a local maximum at x = 0. See Figure 6.8. • The above rather simple example can be analysed without resorting to derivatives higher than the first, but it serves to illustrate the use of the classification theorem. The theorem is not, however, a universal ~anacea. For example, it cannot be applied to the function f(x) = e-t/z , x * 0, f(O) = 0, where t<\">(O) = 0 for all n and f has a stationary point at x = 0.

La- grange's key idea was to represent a function /(x) by its Taylor series and realize f'(x), f\"(x) and so on as coefficients in the cor- responding Taylor expansion of f(x + h) in terms of h (sec 6.3.6). The notation f'(x) in use today is due to Lagrange. However, insuf- ficient attention was paid in Thiorie des fonctions analytiques to matters of convergence and divergence - matters that were success- fully laid to rest by Cauchy in the early nineteenth century. La- grange is better known for his contributions to algebra and number theory. where his concise style and attention to rigour proved much more successful. Section 7.1 discusses the estimation of integrals, and so the integral form of the remainder proves useful in practice. The Lagrange form has already been seen in action in the derivation of the Maclaurin series for ex in Section 6.3, Example 3. The binomial expansion and the series for lo~ (1 + x) are best derived using the Cauchy form of the remainder. •• EXAMPLE l Let f(x) =log~ (1 + x). ~ow 1<r>(x) = _(-1)'-l(r - 1)~ for r ~ 1 (1 + x)' 208 DIFFERENTIATION and so where f(n+ll(c) R,J(x) = Rn,of(x) = 1 (x - c)\"x n. c lying between 0 and x.

CHAPTER SEVEN Integration 7.1 The Riemann integral 7.2 Techniques 7·.3 Improper integrals 7 Historically, the idea of integral calculus developed before that of dif- ferential calculus. Whereas differentiation was created in connection with tangents to curves and maxima and minima of functions, integration arose as a summation procc~s for finding certain areas and volumes. Archi- medes in the third century ac had devised the ingenious method of equi- librium for finding the area of a planar region by subdividing the region into a large number of thin strips. and then hanging these pieces at one end of a lever so that equilibrium was established with a figure whose area and centroid were known. This idea wa~ rediscovered in Europe in the seventeenth century and formulae for the areas between many standard curves were obtained. When Newton discovered the calculus in 1666, the inverse link between finding areas under curves and construct- ing tangents to related curves was firmly established, and Ne~1on appears to be the first mathematician to formally treat integration as the reverse process to differentiation. Section 7.1 begins by defining (indefinite) integration as 'antidifferen- tiation'. This is followed hy a rigorous definition of the Riemann integral (or definite integral), the modern analytic analogue of Archimedes' method for finding areas. The twin concepts of antiderivative (or primi- tive) and the Riemann integral are related by the triumphant fundamental theorem of calculus (7 .1.11), first stated by ISewton in some.what more flowing language a.;; 213 214 INTEGRATION (the) method of tangents ... extends itself not only to the drawing of tangents tu any curved lines . . . but also to the resolving . . . of problems about areas, lengths, centres of gravity etc. Principia 1687 In Section 7 .2 two of the standard techniques of integration are estab- lished: integration by parts and change of variables, which are respect- ively the reverse of the product rule and the composite rule for differenti- ation. The definition of the Riemann integral (see 7.1.1-7.1.3) was coined in the nineteenth century, and has been followed in this century by more general notions of integration. The Riemann integral requires that the function in question be (at least) defined and bounded on a closed bounded interval. Jn Section 7 .3 the effect of relaxing one or hoth of these two boundedness conditions is explored. The resulting improper integrals, which are limits of sequences of (proper) Riemann integrals and arise in areas including mathematical physics and probability theory, are referred to as convergent or divergent integrals depending on whether or not the limit in question exists. 7.1 The Riemann integral Given a function f: A--+ IR, where A is an interval, any differentiable function F: A-+ IR such that F' = f is called a primitive off. If F 1 and F2 are two, possibly different, primitives for f then Fj(x) = F2(x), and so (F1 -F 2)'(x)=O. By the increasing-decreasing theorem (6.2.3), F 1 - F2 is constant on A. Hence any two primitives of f differ by a constant. Therefore the process of finding a primitive of a given function f, if one exists, determines a function F that, up to an additive constant, is unique. The notation F =ff will be used whenever F is a primitive off. •• EXAMPLE! The knowledge of simple differentiable functions and their deriva- tives enables a table of elementary functions and a corresponding primitive to be written down (Table 7.1). • •• EXAMPLE2 Show that sin- 1 x + cos- 1 x = !11', for x e (-1, 1). 7.1 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL 215 I f(x) ~ x\" (n E \\!) f(x) = cosx f(x) = sinx .f(x) -= e\"' f(x).,..., coshx f(x)\"\"' sinhx 1 f(x)- ··-- - · 1 + x~ 1 f(x)=--·· ..

An analogous argument applied to the bijection from (0, ir) onto (-1, 1) given by x >-+cos x yields that cos-- 1 x has derivative -1/Vl - x2 for lxl < 1. Thus F 1(x) = sin-- 1 x and F 2(x) = -cos-- 1 x are both primitives of 1 f(x) = v'l _ x 2 (lxl < 1) Thus F 1(x) - F2(x) = sin-- 1 x + cos-- 1 x is constant for Ix'.< 1. But sin--1 0 + cos--1 0\"\" 0 +!IT. Hence sin 1 x ..... cos-1 x =!IT for x E (-1, 1) • Two questions arise concerning primitives. First, given a function f: A - IP., docs f possess a primitive? Secondly, if f has a primitive, how 216 INTEGRATION y= /(x) x Jc1gu.re7.I is it calculated? Techniques relevant to the second question are discussed in Section 7.2. In order to tackle the first, it is necessary to digress to a discus.~ion of area. It seems reasonable to suppose that there is a well- defined area enclosed by the graph of a continuous function, the x-axis and the ordinates x =a and x = b (see Figure 7.1); this will turn out to be the case for any reasonable function. It is intended to give one form of the definition of the Riemann integral f !/(x) dx, which will assign a value to the aforementioned area. The defillition involves the areas of rectan- gles and applies to a wider class of functions than continuous ones. 7.1.1 Definition Let [a, b] be a given finite interval. A partition P of [a, b] is a finite set of points {x0,xi. ... , xn} satisfying a=x 0 <x 1 < ... <xn = b. Suppose now that f is a function defined and bounded on [a, b] (if f were continuous on [a, bJ, this would certainly be the case by 5.3. l). Then f is bounded on each of the subintervals [xi-t• xi]. Hence f has a least upper bound M; and a greatest lower bound m; on rx;-1>x;).

So there exist numbers Mand m with m :s;; f(x) :si M for all x e la, b]. Thus for any partition P of [a, b] n L(P) ~ Ml:(x; - xi .1) = M(b - a) i~l and n U(P);;;?: m2:(x; - x;_ 1) = m(b - a) i=l Hence the set L -= {l .... (P): Pis a partition of [a, b]} is bounded above and the set U = { U(P): Pis a partition of [a, bl} is bounded below. So !t =sup Land CllL =inf U exist. 7.1.3 Definition A function defined and bounded on [a, b] is Riemann inte- grable on [a, bl if and only if 5R. =au. This common value is denoted by J~f(x) dx. The reason for introducing this notion of integrability is that there arc functions, as will be seen later, for which !t=Fl!t!. Luckily, as will be proved in due course, there are large classes of functions for which 3!, = 6ll., including continuous functions and monotone functions. A f unc- tion f is monotone on an interval [a, bj if f is either increasing on the whole of [a, b] or else decreasing on [a, b]. Before looking at some exam- ples, the intuitively obvious fact that -~~au for a bounded function is established. Georg Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), a German mathematician, was one of the leaders of the nineteenth-century drive towards greater abstTaction and generalization in mathematics. His doctoral thesis in 1851 Jed to the concept of a Riemann surface, and in a famous lecture in 1854 he laid the foundations neccs.c;ary for a uni- fied view of geometry. This resulted in generalized ideas of space. which in tum generated the modern concept of an abstract space and the subject now known as differential geometry. In his relatively short life Riemann made contributions to virtuaJJy every area of pure mathematics, notably in analysis, where he was the first to find 7.1 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL 219 necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded function to be integrable; in honour of this, the Riemann integral is named after him. This notion of intC!.'Tability was generalized during the twen- tieth century but Riemann integration still dominates the under- graduate mathematics curriculum today. 7.1.4 Theorem If f is defined and bounded on [a, b] then :.!. ~ qi. Proof Let P be a partition of [a, b] and P' be the partition PU {y}, where x,_ 1 < y < x, for one particular r, 1 ~ r :soi n. In other words, P' is obtained by adding one more point to P. It is now shown that L(P) ~ L(P') and U(P) ~ U(P'). Let M~ = sup{f(x):x,_ 1 ~x ~ y} and M~ =sup {f(x): y ~ x ~ x,} Clearly M~ ~ M, and M; '5E; M,.

It now follows that if P\" =- P U {y 1, Y2 •... , Ym}, where the Y; are distinct numbers in [a, bJ, then L(P) ~ L(P\") and U(P) ~ U(P\"). Now suppose that P 1 and P 2 are two partitions of [a, b] and let P3 = P 1 U P2• Thus L(P 1) ~ L(P 3) and U(P2) ~ U(P3). Since L(P 3) :s=; U(P3 ), it can be deduced that L(P1) <!1; U(P2). In other words, the lower sum relative to a given partition of [a, b] does not exceed the upper sum relative to any partition of [a, b]. 220 INTEGRATION Hence every lower sum is a lower bound for the set of upper sums.

This turns out to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a bounded function lo be Riemann integrable on la, bJ, a-; the following theorem demonstrates. 7.1.5 Riemann's condition Let f be defined and bounded on [a, b].

(The proof in the case that f is decreasing ir. ~imilar.) :::J Another important consequence of Riemann's condition is that all continuous functions are Riemann integrable. The proof of this result will also require some deeper properticr. of continuous functions than those covered in Chapter 5. Recall that if a function f is continuous on an intcn1al [a, b) then it is continuous for each x 1 , a< x' < b, and it is right-continuous at a and left-continuous at b. So for every x', a < x' < b, and for every t: > 0 there exists a 6 > 0 ')Uch that Ix - x'. < ~=> J(x) - f(x') < e (*) If x'-= a or b, minor adjustments are required to (*) in order to ensure that x c [a, b). The 6 depends of course on the t:' given, but it also depends on the x' under consideration; for a fixed e > 0 each different x' may require a different b > 0 in order for ( *) to be satisfied. This is a direct consequence of the definition of continuity adopted in Section 5.2, where it was the concept of continuity at a point that was first formulated. 224 INTEGRATION If a function f is such that(*) holds, where the 6 can be chosen indepen- dently of x', then f is said to be uniformly continuous on [a, b]. 7.1.7 Definition A function f defined on the interval [a, b], is uniformly con- tinuous if for any given e > 0 there exists a o > 0 such that for all x, y e [a, b] Ix - YI< D ~ lf(x) - /(y)I < 1-: The f, in this definition depends on c, but it does not depend on x or y. The concept of uniform continuity is therefore stronger than the concept of continuity in the sense that all functions that arc uniformly continuous on fa, bl are automatically continuous on fa, b]. What is surprising is that for a closed hounded interval fa, b] the two concepts are in fact equiva- lent. 7.1.8 Uniform continuity theorem Let f be defined and continuous on [a, b]. Then f is uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Proof The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that f is continuous on [a, bJ but not uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Then, the negation of Definition 7 .1. 7, implies that there exists an E > 0 such that for every {J > 0, there are x, ye [a, b ], depending on 6, such that Ix - YI< c5 and l/(x) - /(y)i ~ E In particular, when 6 = 1, there exist Xt. y 1 e [a, b] such that lx1 - Y1I < 1 and lf(x1) - /(_v1)I ~ e When c5 = L there exist x 2 , y 2 e [a, b] such that lx2 - Y2I < ! and lf(x2) - /(y2)I ~ E In general, for every integer n ;;;io 1 there exist Xn, Yn e [a, b] such that (+) Consider the sequence (xn)· Since each Xn e [a, b], the sequence (xn) is bounded. Hence, by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem (3.4.2), (xn) contains a convergent subsequence (xn)· Suppose 7.1 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL 225 that Xn, - c as r - ex:.

Hence continuity on I a, b] implies uniform continuity on I a, b I· D It is worth mentioning at this point that if the closed bounded interval [a, b] in 7 .1.8 is replaced by an infinite interval such as fO, oc) then the result is fals<.:. For example, it can be shown that the function x f--+ x 2 , which is certainly continuous on [O, oo ), is not uniformly continuous on IO, oo). The uniform continuity theorem and Riemann's condition play a key role in the next result, which establishes the fact that continuous functions are Riemann integrable. 7.1.9 Theorem If f is continuous on [a, b] then f is Riemann integrable on [a, b]. Proof Let t: > 0 be given. Then, for a< h, F./(b - a)> 0.

There arc others, notably the Lebesgue integral; all, however, give the same 'answer' for areas under the graphs of continuous functions. The properties detailed in 7 .1.10 are essentially properties of areas. Property (1) is described as the linearity of the integral and (2) is called the additive property. Proof o/(2) Let P 1 and P2 be partitions of [a, cJ and [c, b] respectively. Then P = P1 U P2 is a partition of [a, b ]. Oearly, L(P) = L(P 1) + L(P2). Let :1.1 = sup { L( P 1): P1 is a partition of [a, c]} and :1.2 = sup { L( P2) : P2 is a partition of [ c, b]} By definition, b L(P1) + f,(P2) ~ L f(x) dx Hence b L(P 1) ~ Lt(x) dx - L(P2) and so b !E1 ~ L f(x) d.x - L(Pi) Hence b L(P2) ~ L f(x) dx - ZE1 and so b b :1.2 ~ f,,J(x) dx - :£1, or :£1 + :£2 ~ Lt(x) dx 228 INTEGRATION Now consider upper sums and observe that U(P) = U(P 1) + U(P2).

By adjoining c if necessary, it can be assumed that P contains c. Then P1 = P n [a, c] and P 2 = P n (c. b] are partitions of [a, c] and [c, b] respectively. Now fU(P1) - L(P1)] + [U(P2) - L(P2)J = [U(P1) 4- U(P2)] - [L(P1) + L(P2)J = U(P) - L(P) < E 7.1 THE RIEMANN INTEGRAL 229 Hence o~~U(P 1)-L(Pi)<e and O~U(P2)-/,(P2)<£.

See Exercises 7.1. c, The concepts of antiderivative (or primitive) and the Riemann integral may now be formally related in the central result of this section, the fundamental theorem of calculus. 7.1.11 The fundamental theorem of calculus If f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] and F(x) = (~J(t) dt then Fis continuous on [a, bJ. Furthermore, if f is continuous on [a, b] then Fis differentiable on [a, b] and F' = f. Proof Since f is integrable, it is bounded on [a, b].

Since any two primitives off differ by a constant, F may be chosen, in fact, to be any primitive of f and not just the particular one arising in 7.1.11. Kate that this method of evaluating defin- ite integrals hinges on the ability to determine a primitive off. Unfortun- ately, most functions do not possess primitives expressible in terms of the elementary functions alone. In such cases it is necessary to settle for numerical estimates. • • EXA:vtPLE 5 Determine the area bounded by the function f(x) - x 3 + 2, the x-axis and the ordinates x = 0 and x = l.

The definition of the Riemann integral involved rectangles whose 'heights' were given by certain values of the function f- If any of these values are negative, the rectangle in- volved contrihutes negatively to the upper or lower sum being calculated.

APPENDIX The Elementary FunctiQns The end of Section 4.3 gives the power ~eries definitions of the functions sine, cosine and exponential. The arithmetic of power series (4.3.2) en- able!! the derivation of many of the arithmetical properties of these func- tions. The purpose of this appendix is to establish that sine, cosine, ex- ponential and other functions defined in terms of them are (at least) differentiable. By 6.1.2, these elementary functions are thus continuous, and hence, by 7.1.9, they are Riemann integrable. Consider the power series :L~~oanx\" and suppose that its radius of convergence is R > 0. Now consider the power series \"° a L __ n_xn+l n=O n + 1 obtained respectively from :2: :=oa11x11 by differentiating and integrating term by term. The following theorem will be proved. A.1 Theorem and \"' 2: ~!!·-·· Xn 11 n-0 n + 1 both have radius of convergence R. Proof Suppose that L;_1na 11x 11 - 1 has radius of convergence R 1 • Let Ix·< R and choose a real number c such that lxl < c < R. Then L :~oa11c 11 is convergent, and so. by the vanishing condition 155 256 APPENDIX ( 4.1.2), anc·n - 0 as n - oc. Hence there is a number M such that lancnl ~ M for n = 0, 1, 2, ....

By the ratio test (4.2.3), L:'~onr 11-1 converges, and hence L;=1na11x 11- 1 is (absolutely) convergent for lxl < R by the first comparison test (4.2.1). Hence R 1 ~ R. Suppose that R1 > R and let y be any real number satisfying R < y < R1. Then L~,,,1na,1y11-1 is absolutely convergent. Now and so, by the first comparison test (4.2.1), 1 00 - L a,.yn Y n=I is convergent. By 4.1.4, L;=0a11y 11 converges, and this contradicts the definition of R. Hence R 1 > R is false, and so R 1 = R as claimed. Now consider ~~xn+l n=O n + 1 Suppose that this series has radius of convergence R 2 . Tcrm-hy- term differentiation brivcs the series L :-oa11x11 , which has radius of convergence R. By the first part of the proof, R = R 2 • n The key theoretical result of this appendix c.an now be established. A.2 The calculus of power series If L:;=0a,.x\" has radius of convergence R then, for lxl < R, (1) f(x) = 2::-oa11x\" is differentiable and f'(x).:: 2.: nanxn-1 n=l (2) f(x) = L ~=oanX 11 possesses the primitive THE ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS 257 Proof For (1) let c E (- R, R) and choose r E (0, R) such that c E (- r, r). Now consider all non-zero h safo;fying lhi < r - lei. In other words, c + h E (-r, r). ~ow f(c + h) - f(c) - ~ nancn-1 = __!_ ~ a,.[(c + /z)\" h n. l h n=l - c\" - hnc\"- 1 ] Taylor's theorem (6.3.5) applied to the function x ~ xn on the interval with endpoints c and c + h gives (l: + h)\" = c'1 + nhc:\"- 1 + ~n(n - l)h 2 (c: + Oh)\"-2 for some 0, 0 < e < 1. Hence I f(c + h) - f(c) ~ n •I · -Lnac · h n=l \" ,..11hl 2: 'a\"ln<n - 1).c +eh:\" 2 n-1 .;;- ~lhi L la,.ln(n - l)r\"- 2 n=l By A.l, L~-1na,.r\"- 1 has radius of convergence R, and hence so does \"L;=2n(n - l)a 11r\"-2 • Hence L;-2n(n - l)a,.r\" 2 is ahso- lutely convergent, and so is a fixed finite number. Therefore lim I f(c + h) -_[(c) - i: na,.cn-11 = 0 h->0 h n=l This proves (1). To establish (2), let F(x) = i: ~- -x\"+I n=O n + 1 and apply {l) and A.1 to deduce that F'(.x) = f(x). D It follows immediately from A.land A.2 that if 2:-oa11x\" is a power series with radius of convergence R then f(x) = L ~=oa,.x 11 is infinitely differentiable on ( - R, R). Recall now that the exponential, sine and cosine functions are defined a1;, follows. 258 APPENDIX A.3 Definition The exponential function exp: IR-+ IR is given by oc \" expx = 2: ~ ,.,.o n. A.4 Definition The sine function sin: R-+ IR is given by • 00 (-l)\"x2n+l smx = 2: 1 11,. 0 (2n + 1). A.5 Definition The cosine function cos: R- R is given by \"° (-l)\"xz\" cosx = 2: ---- n-0 (2n)! Since the above power series converge for all x E ~.the functions exp, sin and cos are infinitely differentiable. In particular, they are continuous and Riemann integrable. Term-by-term differentiation of the power series involved confirms the entries in Table 6.1. Theoretical results con- cerning differentiable functions can now be used to establish the familiar properties of the elementary functions. For example, a far easier proof of the identity cos2 x + sin 2 x = 1 than that given in Example 3 of Section 4.3 may now be furnished. Let f(x) = cos2 x + sin 2 x, a function differen- tiable for all r by virtue of the sum and product 111les for differentiation. Differentiating gives f'(x) = -2cosxsinx + 2sinxcosx = 0 Hence, by the increa~ing-decreasing theorem {6.2.3), f(x) = k, a con- stant. Since f(O) = 1, this constant k is unity. In other words, cos2 x + sin2 x = 1 for all x e JR. Additionally, sin and cos have the properties suggested in the graphs in Figure A.1. To establish these, note that THE ELEMENTAR.Y FUNCTIONS 259 y Hence sin x > 0 certainly for 0 < x < 2. Since the derivative of cos x is -sin x, it can be deduced from the increasing-decreasing theorem (6.2.3) that cos is strictly decreasing on lO, 2]. Now cosO = 1, and inspection of the power series defining cosx soon gives that cos2<0. Hence, by the intermediate value property (5.3.2), cosx vanishes somewhere in (0, 2). Since cos is strictly decreasing on [O, 2), there is a unique value of x in (0, 2) satisfying cosx = 0. Hence, !7r is defined to be this unique value of x. In other words, cos ~rr = 0. Using cos2 x + sin 2 x = 1 and substituting x = !17' quickly gives sin 'l7T = 1. Now cosx > 0, 0 ~ x < ~1T, and so, by the increasing-decreasing theorem, sin is strictly increasing on [O, !uJ. Since sin (-x) = -sinx and cos (-x) = cosx (Question 4(a) of Exercises 4.3), the graphs of y = sinx and y = cosx on the interval [-!'IT, !17] are as described in Figure A.1. To complete the graphs, it must be established that sin (x + !7T) = cos x cos (x + ~11\") = -sin x sin (x + 211) = sin x and cos (x + 217) = cosx for all x e R. These all follow from the addition formulae sin(a + b) =sin a cos b +cos a sin b and cos(a + b) = cosacosb - sinasinb 260 APPENDIX which will now be established. Let f(x) =sin (a + x) cos(b - x) + cos(a + x)sin (b - x) for x e IR Now f is differentiable on IR, and, after a straightforward calculation, f'(x) = 0. Apply the increasing-decreasing theorem (6.2.3) to f on the interval [O, b) to deduce that /(x) is constant on (0, b]. Hence f(b) = f(O). Thus sin(a + b) = f(b) = f(O) = sin a cos b -+- cos a sin b The second addition formula is proved similarly. Thus the key analytic properties of elementary functions such as sin and cos can be established from their power series definitions. Note also in the above that the number TT is defined analytically via cos ~11 = 0. This definition of 11 coincides with the more familiar geometric defini- tion that r. is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter, and that, as a consequence, a circle of radius r has area 7rr 2 • To see this, first note that the equation x 2 + y 2 = 1 represents a circle of unit radius, centre (0,0). The portion of thls circle in the positive quadrant (x;;.: 0 and y ~ 0) has equation y = ~ Now the area of this quarter-circle is given by the integral 1 J0 vT=°?dx The substitution x = sin 8 gives f 1 ~ dx = r° - sin 8 V 1 - cos2 fJ dfJ Jo );;/Z since cos() - 1 and, using the analytic definition of 11 given above, cos ~1T = 0.

But the area of the circle x 2 + y 2 = 1 is given by r.(1) 2 = 11. using the geometru: definition of 7f. Hence the area of the quarter-circle is also !11. where 11 is the geometric ratio of the circum- ference of a circle to its diameter. Therefore the two definitions of r., the geometric and the analytic, do indeed coinddc. Kow the following rigorous definitions can be made.

Its nth derivative is given in Example 7(c) of Section 6.2. The logarithm function can now he used to define powers of real numbers, including irrational powers. A.11 Definition If a> 0 and x e R then define a-<= exp (x loge a).

Since the sign of h(x) is always the same as the sign of x, if h(x;) = h(x2) then either .:ti= xi or else 2.t: -= 2x2 . Hence x 1 = x. 2, and so h is injective. Also, h{R) -= li1. (d) Not bijective.

Now x ~ :::x 2 are continuous at x = 0 and f(O) ~ ±0 2 , and su. by the sandwich rule, I is continuous at x ~ 0. Hence f is continuous on IR. The function f: [R!+--+ iRj+ given by f(x) = x 2 is a continuous bijec- tion. Its inverse is the function x >-> Vx, x > 0, which is thus continuous by the inverse rule. The function x ~ cosh- 1 x, x > t, is the inverse of the function f:!R+~(l,x) given by f(x)=-coshx. The rules show that f is continuous.

This bisection process can be continued indefinitely in order to ;trap' the root of P to any desired degree of accuracy. In fact, P(x) '\"\"\"0 in (0, l] for x =0.3473. 2. The interval theorem states that, for a continuous function f, f(J) is an interval. To determine this interval, we have to find the maximum and minimum values off on J. (a) On Jo-: [- L 1], f(x) = x 2 has a minimum value of 0 at x = 0 and a maximum value of l at x -= ± l. Hence f(J) = (0, 1). See Figure S.3(a).

By Rolle's theorem, P'(c) - 0 for some c between x 1 and x 2 • But P'(x) = 3x 2 + a > 0 for all x Hence P'(c) * 0. This contradiction shows that P has precisely one real root. 2. Suppose that c1 and c2 arc distinct fixed points of f. Then h(c:1) = h(c2) = 0. Since h is differentiable on, (0, 1) and continuous on fO, 1], Rolle's theorem implies that h'(c) = 0 for some c between c1 and c2 • Hence f'(c) = 1. But f'(x)4' 1 on (0, 1), and this is the desired contradiction. Therefore f has precisely one fixed point. 3. By Rolle's theorem f'(c:) = 0 for some Ci. a 1 < c1 < a 2 and f'(c 2 ) = 0 for some c2, ai < c2 < a3.

Since f'(x) > 0 for x < 0 and f'(x) < 0 for x > 0, f is increasing on ( -oo, 0) and decreasing on (0, oo). Hence f has a local maximum at x = 0. See Figure SA(b).
