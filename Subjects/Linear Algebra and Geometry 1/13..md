# Operations on Linear Maps
## Composition
### Definition 1.1: Composition of Linear Maps
Let ${} T: \mathbb{F}^{n}\to{}\mathbb{F}^{M}$, and ${} S: \mathbb{F}^{m}\to{}\mathbb{F}^{k} {}$ (note that the range of $T {}$ is the domain of $S {}$)
If ${} T,\, S {}$ are both linear, then ${} S\circ T: \mathbb{F}^{n}\to{}\mathbb{F}^{k} {}$ is also linear. That is, this diagram commutes:
