### Proposition 1.1
A collection of vectors ${} \mathbf{v}_{1},\,\dots,\,\mathbf{v}_{n}\in V {}$ is a basic of $V {}$ if and only if it is linearly independent and spans $V {}$
#### Proof: 
#todo 
#### Example:
Let ${} S=\{ (x,\, y,\, z)\in \mathbb{R}^{3} \mid x+2y=z\} {}$. Find a basis for $S$.
##### Solution:
Take ${} \mathbf{v}=(x,\, y,\, z)\in S {}$. Then ${} x+2y=z {}$. So
$$
\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ x+2y \end{pmatrix}=x \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} +y \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
$$
Therefore, ${} (1,\, 0,\, 1) {}$ and ${} (0,\, 1,\, 2) {}$ span $S {}$. Since they are also linearly independent, they form a basis for ${} S {}$. 
#### Consequence:
Removing things from linearly independent sets keeps them linearly independent sets, although it can stop them from spanning
So any finite set that spans, contains a basis.
