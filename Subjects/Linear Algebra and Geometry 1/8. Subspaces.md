# Subspaces
## Introduction
### Informal Definition
A subspace is just a subset of a vector space such that the operations still hold and are closed over that subset.

### Definition 1.1
Let ${} (V,\, +,\,\cdot )  {}$ be a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F} {}$. A non-empty subset ${} W\subseteq V$ is a subspace of $V {}$ if the following hold:
1. For all ${} \mathbf{u},\, \mathbf{v}\in W {}$, ${} \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}\in W {}$ (closure under addition)
2. For all ${} \mathbf{v}\in W {}$, $\alpha \in \mathbb{F} {}$, ${} \alpha \mathbf{v}\in W {}$ (closure under scalar multiplication)

Key point: we don't need to check if the vector space rules are satisfied, as we automatically know that they are satisfied in $V$. 

#### Remark:
This is equivalent to:
3. for all ${} \mathbf{u},\, \mathbf{v}\in W {}$, and every ${} \alpha,\, \beta \in \mathbb{F} {}$, then ${} \alpha \mathbf{u}+\beta \mathbf{v}\in W {}$

Note that ${} \span\{W\}\subseteq{} W {}$, and so $\mathbf{0}\in W$
