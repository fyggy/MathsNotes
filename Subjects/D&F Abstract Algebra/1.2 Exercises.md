1. 
a) The orders of the elements in $D_{6}$ is 
$$
\begin{align}
|1| & =1 \\
|r| & =3 \\
|r^{2}| & =3 \\
 |s| & =2 \\
|sr| & =2 \\
|sr^{2}| & =2 \\
\end{align}
$$
b) The orders of the elements in $D_{8}$ are
$$
\begin{align}
|1| & =1 \\
|r| & =4 \\
|r^{2}| & =2 \\
|r^{3}| & =4 \\
|s| & =2 \\
|sr| & =2 \\
|sr^{2}| & =2 \\
|sr^{3}| & =2
\end{align}
$$
c) The orders of the elements in ${} D_{10} {}$ are
$$
\begin{align}
|1| & =1 \\
|r| & =5 \\
|r^{2}| & =5 \\
|r^{3}| & =5 \\
|r^{4}| & =5 \\
|sr| & =2 \\
|sr^{2}| & =2 \\
|sr^{3}| & =2 \\
|sr^{4}| & =2
\end{align}
$$

Let ${} x \in  D_{2n}$. Therefore, $x=s^{k}r^{j}$, for ${} k \in  \{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$ and ${} j \in \{ 0,\, 1,\, \dots,\, n-1 \} {}$. By hypothesis, we have ${} k=1 {}$. Therefore, we have 
$$
\begin{align}
 rx & =rsr^{j} \\
 & =sr^{-1}r^{j} \\
 & =sr^{j-1} \\
 & =sr^{j}r^{-1} \\
 & =xr^{-1}
 \end{align}
$$

Let $G$ be a group, and let $x,\, y$ be elements of order $2$ in $g$. Let $t=xy {}$. Then ${} tx=xyx=xy^{-1}x^{-1}=x(xy)^{-1}=xt^{-1} {}$.
7. 
Let $G=\langle a,\, b \mid a^{2}=b^{2}=(ab)^{n}=1  \rangle {}$, for some ${} n \in  \mathbb{Z}_{>0} {}$. Let ${} s=a {}$, and let ${} r=ab {}$. Then $r^{n}=(ab)^{n}=1,$ and ${} s^{2}=a^{2}=1 {}$. Finally, ${} rs=aba=ab^{-1}a^{-1}=a(ab)^{-1}=ar^{-1}$. Therefore, this group satisfies all the same relations as ${} D_{2n} {}$.

9. 
The tetrahedron has ${} 4 {}$ vertices, so we are looking at permutations of ${} C=\{ 1,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4 \} {}$. Given a element ${} i \in C$, we have exactly 3 symmetries that send vertex $1$ to vertex $i$, as we may rotate the tetrahedron around the vertex $i$ and still have a permutation that sends $1$ to $i$. There are $3$ possible rotations, so there are ${} 4\times3=12$ possible symmetries of a tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$
10. 
The cube has 8 vertices, so we are looking at permutations of ${} C=\{ 1,\, 2,\,\dots,\,8 \}$. Given an element ${} i \in C {}$, we have again 3 possible symmetries that send vertex $1$ to vertex $i {}$. This can be seen by viewing the furthest 3 vertices from ${} i {}$, and seeing that they form a equilateral triangle perpendicular to the rotation line through $i$. Therefore, there are ${} 8\times3=24$ possible symmetries of a cube in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

12. 
A dodecahedron has ${} 20 {}$ vertices, so we are looking at permutations of ${} C=\{ 1,\, 2,\,\dots,\,20 \} {}$. Given an element ${} i \in  C {}$, we have exactly $3$ possible symmetries that send $1$ to $i {}$, as each point is the confluence of $3$ faces, so we may rotate the shape around this point with ${} 3$-fold symmetry. Therefore, we have ${} 20\times 3=60 {}$ possible symmetries of a dodecahedron in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
