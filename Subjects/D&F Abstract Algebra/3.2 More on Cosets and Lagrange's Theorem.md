Let $G$ a group with ${} |G|=pq {}$ for ${} p,\, q {}$ prime with $p\neq q$. Then by Caley's theorem, there exists a subgroup ${} P\leq G {}$ with ${} |P|=p {}$ and a subgroup ${} Q\leq G {}$ with ${} |Q|=q {}$. We now have four possibilities for the order of ${} Z(G)$. Either ${} |Z(G)|=1,\, p,\, q,\, pq {}$. 

If ${} Z(G)=p {}$, then ${} |G/Z(G)|=q {}$, so ${} G /Z(G) {}$ is cyclic, and $G {}$ is abelian. But that means that $Z(G)=G {}$, so ${} |Z(G)|=pq\neq p {}$. Therefore, $Z(G)\neq p {}$. Likewise, ${} Z(G)\neq q {}$. Therefore, ${} Z(G)=1 {}$, or $Z(G)=G {}$, so $G$ is abelian

Let $H\leq G$, and let ${} g \in G {}$. Suppose that ${} Hg=kH {}$ for some ${} k \in G {}$. Then ${} g \in Hg {}$, so ${} g \in kH {}$, so ${} kH=gH {}$. Therefore, ${} Hg=gH {}$, so ${} gHg^{-1}=H {}$, so ${} g \in N_{G}(H) {}$

Let ${} H,\, K\leq G {}$ be finite subgroups. Suppose ${} \gcd(|H|,\, |K|)=1 {}$. Let ${} h=|H|,\, k=|K| {}$ and ${} a=|H\cap K| {}$. Now since ${} H\cap K \leq H {}$, then $a \mid h {}$. Likewise, ${} H\cap K \leq K {}$, so $a \mid k {}$. Therefore, ${} a \mid \gcd(h,\, k) {}$. So ${} a=1 {}$, therefore, ${} H\cap K = \{ 1 \} {}$
