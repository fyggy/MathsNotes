Let $G$ a group with ${} |G|=pq {}$ for ${} p,\, q {}$ prime with $p\neq q$. Then by Caley's theorem, there exists a subgroup ${} P\leq G {}$ with ${} |P|=p {}$ and a subgroup ${} Q\leq G {}$ with ${} |Q|=q {}$. Then ${} P \cap Q=\{ 1 \} {}$, as their intersection must have an order that divides both ${} p$ and $q$. We now have for possibilities for the order of $Z(G)$. Either ${} |Z(G)|=1,\, p,\, q,\, pq {}$. If ${} Z(G)=p {}$, then ${} |G/Z(G)|=q {}$, so ${} G /Z(G) {}$ is cyclic, and $G$ is abelian. But that means that $$
