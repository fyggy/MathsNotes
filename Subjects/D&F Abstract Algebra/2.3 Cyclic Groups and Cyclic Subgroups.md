1. 
The subgroups of ${} \mathbb{Z}_{45} {}$ are 
$$
\begin{gather}
\{ 1 \} \\
\{ 1,\, x^{15},\, x^{30} \} \\
\{ 1,\, x^{9},\, x^{18},\, x^{27},\, x^{36} \} \\
\{ 1,\, x^{5},\, x^{10},\, x^{15},\, x^{20},\, x^{25},\, x^{30},\, x^{35},\, x^{40} \} \\
\{ 1,\, x^{3},\, x^{6},\,\dots,\,x^{39},\, x^{42} \} \\
\{ 1,\, x,\, x^{2},\, x^{3},\,\dots,\,x^{42},\, x^{43},\, x^{44} \}
\end{gather}
$$
We have the following lattice

2. 
Let $G$ be a group with ${} x \in G$ with ${} |x|=|G|$. Then there are $|x|=n$ *distinct* elements, as if they weren't distinct, then the order would be smaller. Now ${} |\langle x \rangle |=|G| {}$, and ${} \langle x \rangle \leq G$, as $x \in G.$ Therefore, ${} \langle x \rangle  {}=G$.

For a counter example, note that in $\mathbb{Z} {}$, ${} |\mathbb{Z}|=|2| {}$, but ${} \langle 2 \rangle =2\mathbb{Z}\neq \mathbb{Z} {}$.
