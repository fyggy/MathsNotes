# Basic Axioms and Examples
### Definition 1.1: Binary Operations
1. A binary operation ${} *$ on a set $G {}$ is a function that maps from $G\times G {}$ to $G$, that is, ${} *:G\times G\to{}G$. We write $a*b$ instead of ${} *(a,\, b) {}$
2. A binary operation $* {}$ on ${} G {}$ is called associative if ${} \forall a,\, b,\, c\in G {}$, we have ${} a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c {}$
3. For 2 elements ${} a,\, b\in G {}$, and a binary operation $*$ on $G$, then we say that $a$ and $b$ commute if ${} a*b=b*a {}$. We say that $*$ is commutative if ${} \forall a,\, b\in G {}$, we have ${} a*b=b*a$

Say we have a binary operation $*$ on $G$, and ${} H\subseteq G {}$. If we then have that ${} \forall a,\, b \in  H$, then ${} a*b\in H {}$, then we say that $H$ is closed under $*$. If $*$ is commutative or associative over $G$, then this automatically applies to $*$ over $H$.

### Definition 1.2: Groups
A group is an ordered pair ${} (G,\, *)$, where $G$ is some arbitrary set and $*$ is a binary operation on $G$. This binary operation must satisfy three properties:
1. For all ${} a,\, b,\,c \in G {}$, we have $a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c$, i.e. $*$ is associative
2. There exists an element ${} e\in G {}$ such that for all ${} a\in G {}$, we have ${} a*e=e*a=a {}$. We call this element the identity of $G {}$
3. For all ${} a \in  G$, there exists an element $b=a^{-1}\in G$ such that ${} a*a^{-1}=a^{-1}*a=e {}$. We call this element the inverse of $a {}$, and we write it as ${} a^{-1} {}$.

### Definition 1.3: Abelian Group
We call a group ${} (G,\, *) {}$ abelian if ${} a*b=b*a {}$ for all ${} a,\, b \in  G {}$

Note that axiom $2 {}$ ensures that every group is non-empty

### Proposition 1.4: Basic Group Properties
If ${} (G,\,  * ) {}$ is a group, then
1. The identity ${} e\in G {}$ is unique
2. For all ${} a \in  G {}$, ${} a^{-1}$ is unique
3. For all ${} a \in  G {}$, ${} ( a^{-1} )^{-1}=a {}$
4. For all ${} a,\, b \in  G$, ${} (a*b)^{-1}=(b^{-1})*(a^{-1}) {}$. This is called the socks and shoes theorem.
5. For all ${} a_{1},\, a_{2},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\in G {}$, the value of ${} a_{1}*a_{2}*\dots*a_{n}$ is independent of how the expression is bracketed. This is called the generalised associative law.

#### Proof:
These are standard, except 5, which is an exercise
### Notation:
For general groups, it is cumbersome to use unique notation for everything; instead, we write $a*b=ab$, for some $a,\, b\in G$, and in general, we denote the identity to be $1$. Of course, this doesn't mean we must write every group this way: we also often write additive groups where the operation is $+$ and the identity is $0$, and inverses are denoted by $-n {}$. This is usually done in abelian groups. There is no semantic difference between these 2 notations.

We also write more concise products: for some ${} x \in  G {}$, we write $\underbrace{ xx\dots x }_{ n \text{ times} }=x^{n}$, and $\underbrace{ x ^{-1}x ^{-1}\dots x ^{-1} }_{ n \text{ times} }=x^{-n}$. To complete this notation, we write $x^{0}=1$. 
### Proposition 1.5: Cancellation Laws
Let $G$ be a group, with ${} a, b, x, y\in G {}$. Then the following propositions hold:
1. If ${} ax=ay {}$, then ${} x=y {}$
2. If ${} xb=yb$, then ${} x=y {}$

#### Proof:
1. Multiply both sides on the left by $a^{-1}$. Since this element is unique, then we have ${} x=y {}$.
2. Multiply both sides on the right by ${} a^{-1}$. Since this element is unique, then we have ${} x=y {}$.

### Definition 1.6: Order
Given a group $G$, and ${} x \in G$, define the order of $x$ to be smallest positive integer ${} n \in\mathbb{Z}_{+} {}$ such that ${} x^{n}=1$. Denote this number by $n=|x|$. 

We say that $x$ is of order $n$. If there is no number $n$ such that ${} x^{n}=1 {}$, then the order of $x$ is infinity, we say that $x$ has infinite order

### Definition 1.7: Multiplication Tables
Let ${} G=\{ g_{1},\, g_{2},\,\dots,\,g_{n} \} {}$, with ${} g_{1}=1 {}$. The multiplication table (group table) of $G$ is the $n\times n {}$ matrix, such that the $i^{\text{th}} {}$, $j^{\text{th}} {}$ entry is ${} g_{i}g_{j} {}$.
