1. 
There are ${} 2^{4}=16 {}$ possible matrices. Now we see that if ${} \det(A)=0 {}$, then we have ${} ac-bd=0 {}$, so $ac=bd {}$, with ${} a,\, b,\, c,\, d\in \{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$. Therefore we want ${} ac\neq bd {}$, so ${} ac=1 {}$ and ${} bd=0 {}$ or ${} ac=0 {}$ and ${} bd=1 {}$. If ${} ac=1 {}$, the ${} a=c=1 {}$, and ${} bd=0$ means either ${} b=d=0 {}$, or ${} b=0 {}$, ${} d=1$, or ${} b=1,\, d=0 {}$. Therefore, we have $3$ possibilities. Likewise if ${} ac=0$. Therefore, there are $6 {}$ possible matrices

${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}  \right| =1 {}$
${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}  \right| =2 {}$
${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}  \right| =2 {}$
${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  \right|=2$
${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  \right| =3$
${} \left| \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}  \right| =3 {}$

If ${} n {}$ is not prime, then it must have some divisor ${} m {}$ such that ${} n=mk {}$ for some $k {}$. Consider the element ${} [m]_{n}$. It does not have an inverse, as ${} [k]_{n}[m]_{n}=[km]_{n}=[0]_{n} {}$. Therefore, if there existed some number $j$ such that ${} [mj]_{n}=[1]_{n} {}$, then ${} [0]_{n}=[0\cdot j]_{n}=[k]_{n}[m]_{n}[j]_{n}=[k]_{n} {}$. Therefore, ${} 0\equiv k$, which is ridiculous, as then ${} k=nq {}$, but ${} k<n {}$. Therefore, if ${} n$ is not prime, then ${} \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} {}$ is not a field.

Suppose that $F$ has a finite number of elements. Let ${} m=|F|$. Then there are at most ${} m^{n^{2}} {}$ possible matrices, which is finite. 
Now suppose that ${} F$ has a infinite number of elements. Notice that, if $I {}$ is the identity matrix, that is, the one with ${} 1\in F {}$ along the diagonal, then for all non-zero ${} a \in F {}$, $aI {}$ is a matrix. with non-zero determinant. These matrices correspond 1 to 1 with elements of ${} F$, so it has infinite elements
