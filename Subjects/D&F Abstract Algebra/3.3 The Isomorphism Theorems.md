1. 
We showed that ${} GL_{n}(F) / SL_{n} {}(F)\cong F^{\times } {}$. Since every element of $F$ is invertible except $0$, then
$$
|GL_{n}(F): SL_{n}(F)|=q-1
$$
2. Proof of the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem
Let $G {}$ be a group, and let $N {}$ be a normal subgroup. Let ${} \mathcal{A} {}$ be the set of subgroups of $G$ which contain $N$. Let ${} \bar{\mathcal{A}}$ be the set of subgroups of ${} \bar{G}=G /N {}$. Let ${} \theta:\mathcal{A}\to{}\bar{\mathcal{A}} {}$ be defined by 
$$
\forall A \in \mathcal{A}:\theta(A)=A /N
$$
First, let ${} A,\, B \in  \mathcal{A} {}$ such that ${} \theta(A)=\theta(B) {}$. Then ${} A /N = B / N {}$. Given an element ${} a \in A {}$, there must exist an element ${} b \in B {}$ such that ${} aN=bN {}$. But we know that this means that ${} a \in bN {}$, so ${} a \in B {}$, as the cosets union to $B$. Therefore, ${} A\subseteq  {}$. Through the same argument, we can show that ${} B\subseteq A {}$, so ${} A=B {}$. Therefore, $\theta {}$ is injective. 

Now let ${} \bar{A} \in \bar{\mathcal{A}} {}$ be a subgroup. Then take ${} A=\bigcup_{C\in \bar{A}}C  {}$ be the union over the cosets. This is a subset of ${} G {}$ containing $N$, as ${} N \in \bar{A} {}$. Now let ${} a,\, b \in A {}$. There must exist some cosets ${} X,\,Y \in \bar{A} {}$ with ${} a \in X {}$ and ${} b \in Y {}$. Therefore, there must exist some coset $XY^{-1} {}$ containing ${} ab^{-1} {}$. Therefore, ${} ab^{-1} \in A {}$, so ${} A\subseteq G {}$, so ${} A \in \mathcal{A} {}$. Since ${} N \subseteq A {}$, then $N\trianglelefteq A {}$. Now Take ${} \tilde{A}=A/N {}$.
