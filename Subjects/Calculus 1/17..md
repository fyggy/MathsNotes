### 
The fundamental theorem of calculus has ${} 2 {}$ important uses:
1. It guarantees that all continuous functions on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ have an antiderivative
2. It allows us to differentiate functions defined by integrals

Now we wonder if anti derivatives are unique. The answer is very quickly no, as if $F$ is a function, then 
$$
F'(x)=f(x)=(F(x)+c)'
$$

### Theorem 1.1: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus part 2
Let ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ be a function (not necessarily continuous) which is Riemann integrable. Suppose also that ${} F:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous such that ${} F'(x)=f(x) {}$ for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$. Then
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \ud x =F(b)-F(a)=\left[ F(x) \right] _{a}^{b} \quad \text{    (notation)}
$$
#### Remark:
$F$ may be *any* antiderivative of $f$, not necessarily the one defined in FTC part 1.
#### Corollary:
If ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}R {}$ is Riemann integrable, and ${} F,\, G:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ are antiderivatives for $f$, then there is some ${} c \in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that for all ${} x \in [a,\, b] {}$
$$
F(x)=G(x)+c
$$
#### Proof:
Since ${} F,\, G {}$ are antiderivatives, by FTC part 2, 
$$
\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \ud t =F(x)-F(a)
$$
and
$$
\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \ud t=G(x)-G(a) 
$$
Therefore, ${} F(x)-F(a)=G(x)-G(a) {}$, so ${} F(x)=G(x)+(\underbrace{ F(a)-G(a) }_{ c \in \mathbb{R} }) {}$
In this way, FTC part 2 has 2 important uses:
1. Guarantees antiderivatives are unique up to an additive constant
2. Gives us a practical way to compute integrals
### Example:
Compute
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_{0}^{\tan (x)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^{2}}} \ud t 
$$
Let ${} u(x)=\tan(x) {}$, then
$$
\begin{align}
 \frac{d}{dx} \int_{0}^{\tan(x)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^{2}}} \ud t & =\frac{du}{dx} \frac{d}{dx} \int_{0}^{u} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^{2}}} \ud t \\
 & =\sec ^{2}(x) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+u^{2}}} \\
 & =\sec ^{2}(x) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\tan ^{2}(x)}} \\
 & =\frac{\sec ^{2}(x)}{\sec(x)} \\
 & =\sec (x) 
 \end{align}
$$
### Example:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}  \ud x
