1. 
We have three things to prove:

a) If ${} x=\LIM_{n\tto{} \infty}a_{n} {}$ is a real number, then ${} x=x {}$.
Note that ${} d(a_{n},\, a_{n})=|a_{n}-a_{n}|=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} a_{n} {}$ is $\varepsilon$-close to ${} a_{n}$ for every $\varepsilon>0 {}$, as $\varepsilon>0 {}$. Therefore, ${} a_{n} {}$ and $a_{n}$ are eventually $\varepsilon$-close for all $\varepsilon>0 {}$, so ${} a_{n}$ and ${} a_{n}$ are equivalent. Therefore, 
$$
\LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n}=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n}
$$
so ${} x=x {}$.

b) If $x=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n} {}$ and ${} y=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} b_{n} {}$ with ${} x=y {}$, then ${} y=x {}$
Since ${} x=y {}$, then ${} \LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n}=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} b_{n} {}$, so ${} a_{n} {}$ is equivalent to ${} b_{n}$. Therefore, for every rational $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists $N\geq 0$ with ${} |a_{n}-b_{n}|\leq \varepsilon {}$ for all $n\geq N$. Since ${} |a_{n}-b_{n}|=|b_{n}-a_{n}| {}$, then for every rational $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists $N\geq 0$ with ${} |b_{n}-a_{n}|\leq \varepsilon {}$ for all $n\geq N$. Therefore, ${} b_{n}$ is equivalent to ${} a_{n}$, and ${} \LIM_{n\tto\infty} b_{n}=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n} {}$. Therefore, ${} y=x {}$.

c) If ${} x=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} a_{n},\, y=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} b_{n},\, z=\LIM_{n\tto\infty} c_{n} {}$, with ${} x=y$ and ${} y=z {}$, then ${} x=y {}$.
Since ${} x=y$ and ${} y=z {}$, then as above we have that for every rational $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists a $N\geq 0 {}$with ${} |a_{n}-b_{n}|\leq \varepsilon {}$, and a $M\geq 0$ with ${} |b_{n} - c_{n}|\leq \varepsilon {}$. Note that 
$$
|a_{n}-c_{n}|=|a_{n}-b_{n}+b_{n}-c_{n}|\leq |a_{n}-b_{n}|+|b_{n}-c_{n}|
$$
Therefore, there exists a ${} N,\, M\geq0 {}$ with $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ ${} \varepsilon /2 {}$-close for all $n\geq N$, and $b_{n}$ and $c_{n}$ ${} \varepsilon /2 {}$-close for all ${} n\geq M {}$. Therefore, if ${} L=\max(N,\, M) {}$, then for all $n\geq L$, 
$$
\begin{align}
|a_{n}-b_{n}|  & \leq \varepsilon /2 \\
|b_{n}-c_{n}|  & \leq \varepsilon /2
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, ${} |a_{n} - c_{n}|\leq \varepsilon /2 +\varepsilon/2 =\varepsilon {}$. Therefore, ${} a_{n}$ and $c_{n} {}$ are also eventually ${} \varepsilon$-close. Since our choice of $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, then $a_{n}$ and $c_{n}$ are equivalent, so ${} x=z {}$
