### First some notation
Write $H\leq G$ means "$H$ is a subgroup of $G$". We also write $H<G$ if $H\leq G$ and $H\neq G$
Throughout the lecture, let ${} (G, *) {}$ be a group with identity element $e$.
# Subgroup Test
### Theorem 1.1: The Subgroup Test
Let ${} H\subseteq G {}$. Then $H\leq G$ iff these 3 conditions hold:
1. If ${} a,\, b \in H {}$, then $ab\in H$
2.
