### Corolerry:
Let ${} g \in  G {}$ and let $n,\, m \in  \mathbb{Z}$.
1. If $g$ has infinite order, then ${} g^{n}=g^{m} {}$ iff ${} n=m$
2. If $\ord(g)=d$, then ${} g^{n}=g^{m}$ iff ${} n\equiv m\:(\mathrm{mod}\  d)  {}$
#### Proof:
1. 
Assume $g^{n}=g^{m}$. Then we have $$
\begin{align}
 g^{-m}g^{n}  & =e\\
\Rightarrow g^{n-m} & =e 
 \end{align}
$$
By above, ${} n-m=0$, so ${} n=m {}$

### Notation:
Let ${} g \in  G {}$
$\langle g \rangle =\{ g^{n}\mid n \in  \mathbb{Z} \}$
#### Examples:
1. 
$G=\mathbb{Z}$, and  ${} m \in  \mathbb{Z} {}$. Then ${} \langle m \rangle =m\mathbb{Z} {}$
2. 
${} G=S_{3}$, and $g=(1\;2 \;3 )$, then
$$
\langle g \rangle =\{ e,\, (1\; 2\; 3),\, (1\; 3\; 2) \}
$$
### Corollary
Let ${} g \in  G {}$
1. If $g$ has infinite order, ${} \langle g \rangle$ has infinite size
2. If ${} \ord(g)=d {}$, then ${} |\langle g \rangle |=d {}$
#### Proof:
1. By Corollary, ${} g^{n}\neq g^{m}\;\;\forall n\neq m$. Therefore, all ${} g^{n} {}$ are distinct for all ${} n \in  \mathbb{Z} {}$, so there are infinite elements in ${} \langle g \rangle  {}$
2. Since ${} g^{n}=g^{m} {}$ iff ${} n\equiv m\:(\mathrm{mod}\  d) {}$, then we have 
$$
\langle g \rangle =\{ e,\, g,\, g^{2},\,\dots,\, g^{d-1} \}
$$
which has size $d$
# Subgroups
### Definition 2.1
Let ${} (G,\, *)$ be a group. A subset ${} H\subseteq G {}$ is called a *subgroup* if $H$ is a group under $*$.
#### Note:
For $H$ to be a subgroup, $*$ must be a binary operation on $H$.
In particular, if ${} a,\, b \in  H {}$, then $a*b \in  H$. We say that $H$ is **closed** under $*$.
#### Example:
1. ${} G =\mathbb{Z} {}$ and ${} H=2\mathbb{Z} {}$
If ${} x,\,  y \in  H {}$, then since an even number plus an even number is even, then $x+y\in H$.
Next, we want to check $+$ is associative in $H$. However, since it is associative in $\mathbb{Z}$, then it must be in $2\mathbb{Z} {}$.
We also have $0 \in  H$, so $H {}$ has an identity.
Finally, is we have ${} x \in  2\mathbb{Z} {}$, then we also have ${} -x \in  2\mathbb{Z} {}$. Therefore, every element in ${} H$ has an inverse.
Therefore, ${} (H,\, +) {}$ is a subgroup of $G$.

2. Non example:
${} G=\mathbb{Z} {}$, and $H=\{ \text{odd integers} \}$
We have ${} 1\in H {}$, but ${} 1+1=2\notin H {}$. Therefore, it is not closed under $+$, so it is not a subgroup of $G$
