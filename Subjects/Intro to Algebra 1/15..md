## Functions on ${} \mathbb{Z}_{n} {}$
A note
### Example:
What's wrong with this sentence?
"Define ${} f:\mathbb{Z}_{3}\to{}\mathbb{Z} {}$ by $f([a]_{3})=a$"
This doesn't make sense:
ex. ${} [0]_{3}=[3]_{3} {}$, but $f([0]_{3})=0\neq 3=f([3]_{3})$.
We say that $f$ is not well defined. That means the formula does not give a map on $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$.
#### Note: 
${} f:\mathbb{Z}_{n}\to{}S {}$ gives a function iff ${} f([a]_{n})=f([b]_{n}) {}$ whenever $[a]_{n}=[b]_{n} {}$ (although not necessarily vice versa). In this case we say that ${} f {}$ is well defined.
### Example:
Let ${} f:\mathbb{Z}_{2}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{\times } {}$ be defined by ${} f([a]_{2})=(-1)^{a} {}$ for all $[a]_{2}\in \mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Show that $f$ is well defined
#### Proof:
Assume ${} [a]_{2}=[b]_{2} {}$. We need to show that ${} f([a]_{2})=f([b]_{2}) {}$. Since ${} [a]_{2}=[b]_{2} {}$, we have ${} a=2k+b {}$ for some ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
f([a]_{2}) & =(-1)^{a} \\
 & =(-1)^{2k+b} \\
 & =(-1)^{2k}(-1)^{b} \\
 & =(-1)^{b} \\
 & =f([b]_{2})
\end{align}
$$
#### Note: 
We have $f$ is a homomorphism. Proof:
let ${} [a]_{2},\, [b]_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
f([a]_{2}+[b]_{2})  & =f([a+b]_{2}) \\
& =(-1)^{a+b} \\
 & =(-1)^{a}(-1)^{b} \\
 & =f([a]_{2})f([b]_{2})
\end{align}
$$
As required.
# Homomorphisms
## Properties of Homomorphisms
All day: take ${} (G_{1},\, *_{1}) {}$ a group with identity $e_{1}$
            take ${} (G_{2},\, *_{2}) {}$ a group with identity $e_{2}$
### Proposition 1.1
Assume $\varphi:G_{1}\to{}G_{2} {}$ is a group homomorphism. Then
1. ${} \varphi(e_{1})=e_{2} {}$
2. ${} \varphi(g^{-1})=\varphi(g)^{-1} {}$
#### Proof:
1. 
We have 
$$
\begin{align}
 \varphi(e_{1})*_{2}\varphi(e_{1}) & =\varphi(e_{1}*_{1}e_{1})   \\
 & =\varphi(e_{1}) \\
 & =\varphi (e_{1})*_{2}e_{2}
 \end{align}
$$
By the cancellation law, ${} \varphi (e_{1})=e_{2} {}$.
2. 
Just need to show that ${} \varphi(g)*_{2}\varphi(g^{-1})=e_{2} {}$
$$
\begin{align}
 \varphi(g)*_{2}\varphi(g^{-1})  & =\varphi(g g^{-1}) &  & \text{ since } \varphi \text{ is a homomorphism}  \\
 & =\varphi(e_{1}) \\
 & =e_{2}
 \end{align}
$$

Therefore, $\varphi(g^{-1})=\varphi(g)^{-1}$.
### Proposition 1.2
If $\varphi:G_{1}\to{}G_{2} {}$ is a homomorphism, then ${} \varphi(g^{k})=\varphi(g)^{k} {}$ for all ${} g \in G {}$ and ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$
#### Proof:
On homework sheet (done it with [[D&F Abstract Algebra]])
### Definition 1.3: Kernel and Image
Let $\varphi:G_{1}\to{}G_{2} {}$ be a homomorphism. The *kernel* of $\varphi$ is 
$$
\ker
