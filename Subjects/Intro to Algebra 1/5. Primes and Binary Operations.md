# Prime Factorisation
## Fundamental Theorem and Lead Up
### Definition 1.1: Not a divisor
If $m$ is not a divisor of $n$, write $m\nmid n$

### Definition 1.2: Prime
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n>1$, Then $n$ is prime iff the only positive divisors of $n$ are $1$ and $n$.

### Lemma 1.3
1. Let $a \in\mathbb{Z}$, and let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ be prime. Then, if $p\nmid a$, $\gcd(a, p)=1$
2. let $p$ and $q$ be primes. then $p\mid q\Rightarrow p=q$
Proof is a homework

### Proposition 1.4
Let $a, b \in\mathbb{Z}$, and let $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ be prime. If $p\mid ab$, then $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$

#### Proof:
Assume $p\mid ab$, and assume $p\nmid a$. By lemma 1.3, $\gcd(a,\,p)=1$. By corollary from Monday last week (I wasn't there lol), $p\mid b$. $\square$

### Corollary 1.5: Extension of Prop 1.4
Assume $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{k}\in\mathbb{Z}$, and let $p \in\mathbb{Z}$ be prime. Then we have $p\mid a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{k}\Rightarrow p\mid a_{i}$ for some $i$.
Proof is a homework again

### Definition 1.6: Prime Factorisation
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. If $n=p_{1}p_{2}\dots p_{k}\quad (1)$, for some primes $p_{1},\,p_{2},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$, then $(1)$ is called a prime factorisation of $n$.

Note: we allow repeats, i.e. we allow $p_{i}=p_{j}$

### Theorem 1.7: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n\geq 2$. Then $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ and primes $p_{1},\dots, p_{k}$ such that
$$
n=p_{1}\dots p_{k}
$$
Furthermore, this factorisation is unique up to reordering of the prime factors.

#### Proof:
##### First, existence:
Case 1: $n$ is prime.
Let $p_{1}=n$. Then $n=p_{1}$ is a prime factorisation.

Case 2: $n$ is any natural number.
We work by induction on $n$

Base Case: $n=2$. This is already done by Case 1.

Induction Hypothesis:
Assume $2, 3, \dots, n-1$ have prime factorisations. 
Consider $n$. If $n$ is prime, we're done. Otherwise, $n$ has a positive divisor $m$ with $n>m>1$, as if it didn't then $n$ would be prime. By the definition of being a divisor, $\exists l \in \mathbb{Z}$ with 
$$
n=ml
$$Note that $n>l>1$. By the induction hypothesis, there exist primes $p_{1}, \dots,p_{k}$ and $q_{1},\dots ,q_{r}$ such that 
$$
\begin{align}
m & =p_{1}\dots p_{k} \\
l & =q_{1}\dots q_{r}
\end{align}
$$
Then we have 
$$
n=p_{1}\dots p_{k}q_{1}\dots q_{r}
$$
As a prime factorisation of $n$.
##### Second: Uniqueness:
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and assume
$$
\begin{align}
n & =p_{1}\dots p_{k} \\
n & =q_{1}\dots q_{r}
\end{align}
$$
For some primes $p_{1},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$ and $q_{1},\,\dots,\,q_{r}$. We need to show that $r=k$, and that we can change the order of the $q_{i}$'s to get
$$
\begin{align}
p_{1} & =q_{1} \\
p_{2} & =q_{2} \\
 & \ \ \vdots \\
p_{k} & =q_{k}
\end{align}
$$
Case 1: $n$ is prime.
$n=p_{1}$ is a prime factorisation. Assume that we have $n=q_{1}\dots q_{r}$ is another. By definition, $q_{1}\mid n$, but by lemma 1.3 part 2, $n$ is prime, therefore, $q_{1}=n=p_{1}$. This means that if $r>1$, then $q_{2},\,\dots,\, q_{r}=1$, but this is a contradiction since they are primes (meaning they're greater than one).
Therefore, we have $r=1$ and $p_{1}=q_{1}$

Case 2: $n$ is arbitrary natural number
Use induction on $n$

Base Case:
$n=2$, meaning $n$ is prime, so this is true by Case 1

Induction Hypothesis:
Assume uniqueness for $2, 3, \dots, n-1$. Consider $n$. If $n$ is prime, there we're done. Otherwise, assume 
$$
\begin{align}
 n & =p_{1}\dots p_{k} \\
 & = q_{1}\dots q_{r} 
 \end{align}
$$
With $p_{1},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$ and $q_{1},\,\dots,\,q_{r}$ prime. We have $p_{1}\mid(q_{1}q_{2}\dots q_{r})$. By Corollary 1.5 we have $p_{1}\mid q_{i}$ for some $i$. By Lemma 1.3 part 2, we have $p_{1}=q_{i}$. By reordering the $q_{i}$, we can assume $i=1$. So now we have $p_{1}=q_{1}$.
Now 
$$
\frac{n}{p_{1}}=p_{2}\dots p_{k}=q_{2}\dots q_{r}
$$
But $\displaystyle\frac{n}{p_{1}}<n$. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, we have that $k=r$, and after reordering, we have 
$$
\begin{align}
p_{2} & =q_{2} \\
p_{3} & =q_{3} \\
\quad\quad&\ \ \vdots \\
p_{k} & =q_{k}
\end{align}
$$$\square$.

### Corollary 1.8: 
Let $a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ not both zero. Then $\gcd(a,\,b)=1$ iff $a$ and $b$ have no common prime divisors.
#### Proof:
Assume $\gcd(a,\,b)=1$ If $p$ is prime, then $p>1$, so therefore $p$ is not a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
Conversely, by the contrapositive, assume that $\gcd(a,\,b)=d\neq 1$. We have $d>1\Rightarrow d\geq 2$. Therefore by Theorem 1.7, $d$ has a prime factorisation. In particular, there exists a prime $p$ with   $p\mid d$. Therefore, $p\mid d$ and $d\mid a$. Therefore, $p\mid a$. In a similar fashion, $p \mid b$. So $p$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
Therefore we have if $a$ and $b$ have no common prime divisors, then $\gcd(a,\,b)=1$

# Binary Operations
## First Contact
### Definition 2.1: Binary Operation
Let $S$ be a set. A binary operation $*$ on $S$ is a function 
$$
\begin{align}
*:S\times S & \to{}{} S \\
(a,\, b) & \mapsto a*b
\end{align}
$$
#### Examples:
Let $S=\mathbb{Z}$
1. $*=+$ Addition is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$
2. $*=\cdot$ Multiplication is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$
3. $*=-$ Subtraction is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$
4. Notable non-example: $*=/$. Division is not a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$
	1. $a/0$ is not well defined
	2. $a/b$ is not always in $\mathbb{Z}$

### Definition 2.2
Let $*$ be a binary operation on $S$. Then $*$ is called:
- Commutative if $a*b=b*a\quad\forall a,\,b \in S$
- Associative if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)\quad\forall a,\,b,\,c \in S$

#### Examples:
1. $*=+$ is commutative and associative, as $a+b=b+a$ and $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ for all $a,\,b,\,c\in\mathbb{Z}$.
2. $*=\cdot$, multiplication is also commutative and associative, similar to above.
3. $*=-$. Subtraction is *not* commutative or associative. For example $0*1=-1\neq 1=1*0$, and $(1-1)-1=-1\neq 1=1-(1-1)$
4. 
$$
S=M_{2}(\mathbb{R})= \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}\mid a, b, c, d \in\mathbb{R}\right\}
$$
- Matrix addition $+$ gives a binary operation on $M_{2}(\mathbb{R})$. $+$ is commutative and associative, trivially
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}
e & f \\
g & h
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
a+e & b+f \\
c+g & d+h
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Clearly, this is both commutative and associative as addition on $\mathbb{R}$ is commutative and associative

- Matrix multiplication also defines a binary operation on $M_{2}(\mathbb{R})$
It is not commutative:
$$
\begin{align}
 \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}  \\
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}= 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
 \end{align}
$$
