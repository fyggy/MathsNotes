## Common Distributions
### Geometric distribution
Designed to model repeated Bernoulli trial until the first success. The number of interest is the number of trials up to and including the first success. 
#### Assumptions:
- ${} \mathbb{P}(\text{success})=p {}$ is fixed across the trials
- The trials are independent
#### Example:
Let $X= {}$the probability of taking $n {}$ rolls to roll a 6 on a fair die  
${} \mathbb{P}(X=8)=\mathbb{P}(\text{FFFFFFFS})=\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{7}\left( \frac{1}{6} \right) {}$

Abstractly, ${} X\sim\mathrm{Geo}\,(p) {}$ if ${} \mathbb{P}(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}p {}$ for $0\leq p\leq 1$
### Poisson Distribution
Designed to model the number of occurrences of a certain event in a fixed interval of time/space, for example, the number of alpha particles from a radioactive source in 1 second, or the number of oak trees in 1 km$^{2}$ of Sherwood Forest

Abstractly, let $\lambda>0 {}$. model the "rate" of singular events. Now
$$
\mathbb{P}(X=k)=e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!}
$$
#### Assumptions:
- events occur randomly and independently
- occur at a uniform average rate ${} \lambda {}$
### Example:
Let ${} X\sim \operatorname{Bin} (n,\, p) {}$, we see that 
$$
\begin{align}
 p_{X}(k) & =\mathbb{P}(X=k)   \\
 & =\binom{n}{k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k} \geq 0
 \end{align}
$$
and that 
$$
\begin{align}
 \sum_{k \in \im X} p_{X}(k) & =\sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbb{P}(X=k)  \\
 & = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} p^{k}(1-p)^{ n-k} \\
	 & =(p+(1-p))^{n} \\
 & =1^{n}
 \end{align}
$$
