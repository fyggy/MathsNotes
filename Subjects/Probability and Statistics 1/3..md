# Conditioning
## 
### Definition 1.1
We denote the probability that ${} A {}$ happens given that ${} B {}$ has happened as 
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B)
$$
We can calculate this as 
$$
\mathbb{P}(A\mid B)=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$
#### Example:
Suppose that we shuffle a standard deck of cards and deal out a hand of $3$ cards. What is the probability of finding at least one ace in this hand?

${} \mathbb{P}(\text{at least one ace})=1-\mathbb{P}(\text{no aces}) {}$.
