### Peano's Theorem
If we have a first order differential equation of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x,\, t)
$$
with initial condition ${} x(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$ and if there exists an open set ${} S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ around ${} (t_{0},\, x_{0}) {}$ where ${} f(x,\, t) {}$ is continuous, then there exists an open set ${} A {}$ around ${} t_{0} {}$ such that there exists a function ${} g:A\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ that satisfies the differential equation and has ${} g(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$. 
### Picard's Theorem
If we have a first order differential equation of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x,\, t)
$$
with initial condition ${} x(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$. If there exists an open set ${} S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ around ${} (t_{0},\, x_{0}) {}$ such that $f$ and ${} \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x }  {}$ are *both* continuous, then there exists a open set $A$ around $t_{0}$ such that there exists a *unique* function ${} g:A\to{}\mathbb{R} {} {}$ that satisfies the differential equation and has ${} g(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$.
#### Example:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =-x^{2},\, \qquad x(2)=1
$$
We have ${} f(x,\, y)=-x^{2} {}$, and ${} \frac{ \partial f(x,\, y) }{ \partial x } =-2x {}$. This is continuous for all ${} (x,\, t) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$. Therefore, there exists a solution on the interval 
$$
(2-\delta,\, 2+\delta)
$$
In order to solve for how large ${} \delta {}$ may be, we must solve the original equation. After solving, we see that the particular solution is
$$
x=\frac{1}{t-1}
$$
This is not defined for ${} t=1 {}$. Therefore, $\delta$ can be at most ${} (1,\, 3) {}$.
