### Peano's Theorem
If we have a first order differential equation of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x,\, t)
$$
with initial condition ${} x(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$ and if there exists an open set around ${} (t_{0},\, x_{0}) {}$ where ${} f(x,\, t) {}$ is continuous, then there exists an open set around $t_{0}$ where the initial condition is satisfied.
### Picard's Theorem
If we have a first order differential equation of the form
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} =f(x,\, t)
$$
with initial condition ${} x(t_{0})=x_{0} {}$. If there exists an open set around ${} (t_{0},\, x_{0}) {}$ such that $f$ and ${} \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x }  {}$ are *both*, then there exists a open set
