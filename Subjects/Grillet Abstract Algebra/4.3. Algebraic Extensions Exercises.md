1. 
Let $S$ such that all ${} \alpha \in S {}$ are algebraic over $K {}$. Suppose that ${} x \in K(S) {}$ is transcendental. Then we have that, if ${} (X_{s})_{s \in S} {}$ is a family of indeterminants, then ${} x=f((s)_{s \in S}) {}$ for some ${} f \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}] {}$. We also have a family ${} (q_{s})_{s \in S} {}$ where each ${} q_{s}(s)=0 {}$ of polynomials in ${} K[X] {}$. Then this family has a least common multiple $q$
