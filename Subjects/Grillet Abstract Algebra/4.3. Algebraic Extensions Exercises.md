1. 
Let $S$ such that all ${} \alpha \in S {}$ are algebraic over $K {}$. Let ${} x \in K(S)$. Then we have that
$$
x=\sum _{i \in I} k_{i} \prod _{j \in J} s_{i,\, j}
$$
with ${} k_{i} \in K {}$ and ${} s_{i,\, j} \in S {}$, and $I,\, J {}$ are finite. Then let ${} T=\{ s_{i,\, j} \mid i \in I,\, j \in J\} {}$ is finite, and $K(T) {}$ is algebraic over $K {}$. Therefore, since ${} x \in K(T) {}$, then $x$ is algebraic over ${} K {}$.
2. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $F$ is algebraic over $K$. Then if ${} e \in E {}$, then ${} e \in F {}$ and $e$ is algebraic over $K$. Furthermore, if ${} f \in F {}$, then there exists a polynomial ${} g \in K[X] \subseteq E[X] {}$ such that ${} g(f)=0 {}$. Therefore, $F$ is algebraic over $E$.

Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $E$ is algebraic over $K$, and $F$ is algebraic over $E$. Now if ${} x \in F {}$, then there exists a non-zero monic polynomial ${} \Irr(x:E) \in E[X] {}$ such that ${} f(x)=0 {}$. Now if ${} (a_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are the coefficients of $f {}$, then
