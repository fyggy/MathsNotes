1. 
Let $S$ such that all ${} \alpha \in S {}$ are algebraic over $K {}$. Let ${} x \in K(S)$. Then we have that
$$
x=\sum _{i \in I} k_{i} \prod _{j \in J} s_{i,\, j}
$$
with ${} k_{i} \in K {}$ and ${} s_{i,\, j} \in S {}$, and $I,\, J {}$ are finite. Then let ${} T=\{ s_{i,\, j} \mid i \in I,\, j \in J\} {}$. For each ${} t \in T {}$, there exist some ${} q_{t} \in K[X] {}$ such that ${} q_{t}(t)=0 {}$. Then let $q$ be the LCM of ${} Q=\{ q_{t} \mid t \in T \} {}$. Now ${} q(t)=0 {}$ for all ${} t \in T {}$, and
$$
q(x)=\sum_{i\in I} q(k_{i}) \prod_{j\in J} q(s_{i,\, j})=0
$$
Since $q$ is a polynomial in $K[X]$, then $x$ is algebraic over $K$, and ${} K(S)$ is an algebraic extension

Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $F$ is algebraic over $K$. Then if ${} e \in E {}$, then ${} e \in F {}$ and $e$ is algebraic over $K$. Furthermore, if ${} f \in F {}$, then there exists a polynomial ${} g \in K[X] \subseteq E[X] {}$ such that ${} g(f)=0 {}$. Therefore, $F$ is algebraic over $E$.

Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $E$ is algebraic over $K$, and $F$ is algebraic over $E$. Now if ${} x \in F {}$, then there exists a polynomial ${} f \in E[X] {}$ such that ${} f(x)=0 {}$. Now if ${} (a_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are the coefficients of $f {}$, then we have a family ${} (q_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ of polynomials in ${} K[X] {}$ such that ${} q_{i}(a_{i})=0 {}$, since $E$ is algebra
