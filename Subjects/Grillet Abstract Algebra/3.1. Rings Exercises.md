Let ${} x',\, n \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} \gcd(x,\, n)=1 {}$. Now ${} x' {}$ induces an element ${} x \in \mathbb{Z}_{n} {}$ with ${} x'\equiv x \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$. Since ${} x',\, n {}$ are relatively prime, then $x$ is a unit. Now ${} x^{a} {}$ is a unit, and in fact, ${} \langle x \rangle  {}$ is a group under multiplication. Now since ${} x',\, n {}$ are relatively prime, then the (additive) order of $x$ is $n$. Now so is ${} x^{a} {}$, since it is a unit. 

Now suppose ${} y \in \mathbb{Z}_{n} {}$ has (additive) order ${} n$. We have that ${} kx=y {}$ for some ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Now ${} \conj{k} {}$ is a unit i
