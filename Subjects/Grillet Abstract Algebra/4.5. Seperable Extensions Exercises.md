1. 
First suppose that $K {}$ is a finite field. Let ${} p=\Char K {}$, and ${} p>0 {}$. Now ${} K^{\times }$ is finite, so is cyclic and generated by a single element $\alpha {}$, and every non-zero value of ${} K$ is some power of $\alpha {}$. Hence ${} \alpha^{k}=1 {}$ iff ${} k=p^{m}-1 {}$, where ${} m=[K:\mathbb{Z}_{p}] {}$, and ${} \alpha {}$ is algebraic. In fact, 
$$
f(X)=\Irr(\alpha:\mathbb{Z}_{p})=X^{p^{m}-1}-1
$$
Now if ${} f(\beta)=0 {}$, with ${} \beta \in \conj{K} {}$, then ${} f'(X)=(p^{m}-1)X^{p^{m}-2} {}$, and so since ${} \beta^{p^{m}-1}=1 {}$, then ${} \beta^{p^{m}-2}=\beta ^{-1} {}$, and 
$$
f'(\beta)=(p^{m}-1)\beta ^{-1}=-\beta ^{-1}
$$
which may only be $0$ if $\beta$ is $0 {}$, which is itself impossible. Therefore, $K$ is separable over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}$, and so a inseparable irreducible polynomial must have coefficients in an infinite field of prime characteristic.

Now we construct such a field. Let ${} p=2 {}$. Then the irreducible polynomials in ${} \deg 2 {}$ are
$$
X^{2}+X+1
$$
and in ${} \deg 3 {}$ are
$$
X^{3}+X+1,\, \qquad X^{3}+X^{2}+1
$$
Now let ${} F=\mathbb{Z}_{2}(X) {}$.
