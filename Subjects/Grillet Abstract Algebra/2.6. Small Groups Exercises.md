1. 
It is not isomorphic to $C_{12}$ or ${} C_{2} \oplus C_{2} \oplus C_{3} {}$, since it is not abelian. Now take ${} (1, r) \in G {}$. We have ${} \langle (1,\, r) \rangle =\{ (0,\, 1),\, (1,\, r),\, (0,\, r^{2}),\, (1,\, 1),\, (0,\, r),\, (1,\, r^{2}) \} {}$ has order $6$, so it cannot be isomorphic to $A_{4}$. Now ${} (1,\, r),\, (0,\, s) {}$ generates ${} G$. We have that
$$
(1,\, r)^{6}=(0,\, 1)\qquad (1,\, 1)^{2}=(0,\, 1)\qquad (0,\, s)(1,\, r)(0,\, s)=(1,\, r^{2})
$$
so ${} G \cong D_{6} {}$
2. 
The abelian groups of order $51 {}$ are 
$$
C_{3} \oplus C_{17}
$$
Now if ${} G$ has order $51 {}$, then the Sylow ${} 17 {}$-subgroups are cyclic, and since ${} 17 {}$ doesn't divide any factors plus one of $51 {}$, then ${} G\cong C_{3} \oplus C_{17} {}$.
3. 
We have that there are either ${} 1$ Sylow $3$-subgroup of $G$, or $7$. If there are $7$, then since they are all cyclic, they are all distinct, so we have $21 {}$ elements of order ${} 3$. But ${} |1|=1 {}$, so this is impossible. Therefore, there is one Sylow ${} 3 {}$-subgroup, and it is normal. Clearly, it has a normal Sylow $7$-subgroup, so
