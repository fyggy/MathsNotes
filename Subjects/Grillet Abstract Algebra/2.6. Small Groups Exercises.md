1. 
It is not isomorphic to ${} C_{12}$ or ${} C_{2} \oplus C_{2} \oplus C_{3} {}$, since it is not abelian. Now take ${} (1, r) \in G {}$. We have ${} \langle (1,\, r) \rangle =\{ (0,\, 1),\, (1,\, r),\, (0,\, r^{2}),\, (1,\, 1),\, (0,\, r),\, (1,\, r^{2}) \} {}$ has order $6$, so it cannot be isomorphic to $A_{4}$. Now ${} (1,\, r),\, (0,\, s) {}$ generates ${} G$. We have that
$$
(1,\, r)^{6}=(0,\, 1)\qquad (1,\, 1)^{2}=(0,\, 1)\qquad (0,\, s)(1,\, r)(0,\, s)=(1,\, r^{2})
$$
so ${} G \cong D_{6} {}$
2. 
The abelian groups of order $51 {}$ are 
$$
C_{3} \oplus C_{17}
$$
Now if ${} G$ has order $51 {}$, then the Sylow ${} 17 {}$-subgroups are cyclic, and since ${} 17 {}$ doesn't divide any factors plus one of $51 {}$, then ${} G\cong C_{3} \oplus C_{17} {}$.
3. 
We have that there there is $1 {}$ Sylow $7 {}$-subgroup of $G {}$, call it $H {}$. Let ${} a \in H {}$, and let ${} b \in G \setminus H {}$. We have that $a$ and $b$ generate $G$, as there are no subgroups larger than $H$. Now
$$
\begin{align}
a^{7}=b^{3}=1,\, \quad bab^{-1} =a^{k}
\end{align}
$$
since $H {}$ is normal. Now note that 
$$
b^{2}ab^{-2}=ba^{k}b^{-1}=a^{k^{2}}\qquad a=b^{3}ab^{-3}=a^{k^{3}}
$$
and so therefore, ${} k^{3}\equiv k\:(\mathrm{mod}\  7)  {}$. Now there are $3$ solutions: ${} k=1,\, 2,\, 4 {}$. If ${} k=1 {}$, then 
$$
ab=ba
$$
and so the group is cyclic, isomorphic to ${} C_{21} {}$. Otherwise, if ${} k=2 {}$, then
$$
b^{2}ab^{-2}=a^{4}
$$
and ${} (b^{2})^{3}=1 {}$. Likewise, if ${} k=4 {}$, then 
$$
b^{2}ab^{-2}=a^{16}=a^{2}
$$
and so 
$$
\langle a,\, b \mid a^{7}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{2} \rangle \cong \langle a,\, b \mid a^{7}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{4} \rangle =G
$$
By convention we choose ${} k=4{} {}$. Now if ${} x \in G {}$, then using ${} ba=a^{4}b {}$, we may put $x$ in the form $$
x=a^{n}b^{m},\quad n=0,\, 1,\,\dots,\,6,\, m=0,\, 1,\, 2
$$We take for granted that a group of order $21 {}$ exists with these relations, and that $G {}$ has at most ${} 21 {}$ elements, from the relation above. Therefore, the groups of order $21 {}$ are
$$
C_{21}; \qquad \langle a,\, b \mid a^{7}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{4} \rangle 
$$
4. 
We see that ${} 39=3\cdot 13 {}$ has $1$ Sylow-$13 {}$ subgroup $H {}$, and so ${} G/H \cong  C_{3} {}$. Now pick ${} a \in H {}$, and ${} b \in G \setminus H {}$. Now ${} a^{13}=1 {}$, and ${} b^{3}=1 {}$. Since $H$ is normal, then 
$$
bab^{-1} \in H 
$$
so ${} bab^{-1} =a^{k} {}$ for some $k {}$. Furthermore, note that 
$$
a=b^{3}ab^{-3}=a^{k^{3}}
$$
so ${} k^{3}\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  13)  {}$. The solutions to this are ${} 1,\, 3,\, 9 {}$. If ${} k=1 {}$, then ${} ab=ba {}$, and so $G\cong C_{31}$. If ${} k=3 {}$, then ${} b^{2}ab^{-2}=a^{9} {}$. Otherwise, if ${} k=9 {}$, then ${} b^{2}ab^{-2}=a^{81}=a^{3} {}$. Therefore,
$$
\langle a,\, b \mid a^{13}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{3} \rangle \cong \langle a,\, b \mid a^{13}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{9} \rangle \cong G
$$
We take for granted that there is a group of order $39 {}$ satisfying these relations, so the groups of order $39 {}$ are
$$
C_{39}; \qquad \langle a,\, b \mid a^{13}=b^{3}=1,\, bab^{-1}=a^{3} \rangle
$$
