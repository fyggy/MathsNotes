1. 
It is not isomorphic to $C_{12}$ or ${} C_{2} \oplus C_{2} \oplus C_{3} {}$, since it is not abelian. Now take ${} (1, r) \in G {}$. We have ${} \langle (1,\, r) \rangle =\{ (0,\, 1),\, (1,\, r),\, (0,\, r^{2}),\, (1,\, 1),\, (0,\, r),\, (1,\, r^{2}) \} {}$ has order $6$, so it cannot be isomorphic to $A_{4}$. Now
