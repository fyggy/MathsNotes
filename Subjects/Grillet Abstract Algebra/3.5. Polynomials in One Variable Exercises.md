Let ${} n=\deg A {}$. Then for each ${} k \in \mathbb{N} {}$, we define ${} N_{k} {}$ and ${} M_{k}$ such that ${} M_{0}$  and ${} N_{0} {}$ are the unique polynomials such that ${} A=M_{0}B+N_{0}$, and then ${} M_{k+1} {}$ and ${} N_{k+1} {}$ are the unique polynomials such that ${} M_{k}=M_{k+1}B+N_{k+1} {}$. Therefore, ${} \deg M_{k+1} \leq \deg  M_{k} {}$, and since $\deg B\geq 1 {}$, then ${} \deg M_{k+1} < \deg  M_{k} {}$, as long as ${} \deg M_{k}>0 {}$. Therefore, eventually there is an $N {}$ such that ${} k\geq n {}$ implies that ${} \deg M_{k}=0 {}$,
