Let ${} n=\deg A {}$. First note that if ${} n=0 {}$, then $A {}$ is a constant, and we may write ${} A=A + B \cdot 0 +B^{2} \cdot  0 +\dots_{} {}$. Since ${} \deg B \geq 1 {}$, then ${} \deg A < \deg  B$. Now suppose that the proposition holds for ${} n\leq k {}$. Now if ${} \deg A=k+1 {}$
$$
A=Q B + S
$$
where ${} \deg S< \deg  B {}$, and ${} \deg Q < \deg A=k+1 {}$, since ${} \deg B \geq 1 {}$. Therefore, we may write $Q$ as
$$
Q=\sum_{i=0}^{\deg Q} Q_{i} B^{i} 
$$
and so setting ${} R_{0}=S {}$ and ${} R_{i+1}=Q_{i} {}$
$$
A=\left(\sum_{i=0}^{\deg Q} Q_{i} B^{i} \right)B + S=\sum_{i=0}^{\deg  Q+1}R_{i} B^{i} 
$$

Let $R \leq S {}$ be a subring. Let ${} s \in S {}$, and suppose that ${} e:R[X]\to{}S {}$ with ${} e(P)=P(s) {}$ is a homomorphism. Now we have, corresponding to every element ${} r {}$ of ${} R {}$, a polynomial $rX$. Evaluating at this polynomial, we see that
$$
e(X)e(r)=sr=rs=e(rX^{2})=e(X \cdot r)
$$
and so $s$ commutes with every element of $R$. Conversely, we have already seen that if $s$ commutes with every element of $R$, then $e$ is a homomorphism
