1. 
We have that ${} F =K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\cong K((X_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$. First, suppose that the ${} ({} \chi_{i} {})_{i \in I} {}$ are algebraic over ${} E {}$. Then ${} K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$ is algebraic over ${} E {}$, and by the tower property, we have a contradiction. Therefore, the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over ${} E {}$. 

Note that ${} F=Q(K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}]) {}$. Then the set of all monomials, ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$, is a basis of ${} F'=K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Since the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over $E$, then if ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$ is non-zero, then ${} f((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\neq 0 {}$. Since each polynomial is a linear combination of the monomials of ${} F' {}$, then the ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$ are linearly independent over $E$. Therefore, $E$ and $F$ are linearly disjoint

Let $K$ be perfect, and let ${} K \subseteq E {}$ be a field extension. Note that if ${} x \in K^{1 /p ^{\infty }} {}$, then ${} x^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for some $m$, and so ${} x \in K {}$. Therefore, ${} K^{1 /p^{\infty }} \subseteq K {}$. Now suppose that ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E {}$ are linearly independent over ${} K$. Therefore, they are linearly independent over ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and $E$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint. Therefore, $E {}$ is separable.

Suppose that ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$, $E {}$ is separable over $K {}$, and that ${} F {}$ is separable over ${} E {}$. Now suppose that ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ is linearly independent over ${} K {}$. Then ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ is linearly independent over $E$, as $E$ is separable over $K$. Furthermore, since ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and is linearly independent over $E$, then ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ is linearly independent over $F$. Therefore, $F$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint over $K$, and $F$ is separable over $K$.

Let ${} K\subseteq E \subseteq L {}$ and ${} K\subseteq  F \subseteq L {}$ be fields with $E,\, F {}$ linearly disjoint over $K {}$. Now suppose that ${} A=\{\alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\} \subseteq  E {}$ are algebraically independent over ${} K$. Then the set of all finite products in $A$, $M$, is linearly independent over $K$. Therefore, $M$ is linearly independent over $F$, and so every polynomial in $A$ is non-zero. Therefore, $A$ is algebraically independent over $F$.

Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq L {}$ and ${} K \subseteq F \subseteq L {}$ be fields with $E$ separable over $K$. Now suppose that ${} A=\{\alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\} \subseteq  E {}$ algebraically independent over $K$ implies that $A$ is algebraically independent over $F$. Now let ${} (x_{j})_{j \in J}=S\subseteq EF {}$ be a finite set. then for each ${} x_{j} \in S {}$, we have 
$$
x_{j}= \frac{\sum_{i\in I} a_{i,j}m_{i,j}}{\sum_{i\in I} b_{i,j}n_{i,j}} 
$$
Now let ${} T=\{ a_{i,\, j} ,\, b_{i,\, j}\mid  i \in I,\, j \in J \} {}$. Since $I$ and $J {}$ are finite, then $T$ is finite and a subset of $E$. Then $E(T)$ has a separating transcendence base $B$. Then $B$ is algebraically independent over $F$
