1. 
We have that ${} F =K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\cong K((X_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$. First, suppose that the ${} ({} \chi_{i} {})_{i \in I} {}$ are algebraic over ${} E {}$. Then ${} K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$ is algebraic over ${} E {}$, and by the tower property, we have a contradiction. Therefore, the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over ${} E {}$. 

Note that ${} F=Q(K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}]) {}$. Then the set of all monomials, ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$, is a basis of ${} F'=K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Since the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over $E$, then if ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$ is non-zero, then ${} f((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\neq 0 {}$. Since each polynomial is a linear combination of the monomials of ${} F' {}$, then the ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$ are linearly independent over $E$. Therefore, $E$ and $F$ are linearly disjoint
2. 
Let $K$ be perfect, and let ${} K \subseteq E {}$ be a field extension. Note that if ${} x \in K^{1 /p ^{\infty }} {}$, then ${} x^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for some $m$, and so ${} x \in K {}$. Therefore, ${} K^{1 /p^{\infty }} \subseteq K {}$. Now suppose that ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E {}$ are linearly independent over ${} K$. Therefore, they are linearly independent over ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and $E$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint. Therefore, $E {}$ is separable. 
3. 
Suppose that ${} F$ is separable over $K$, and $E$ is separable over $F$. Then let ${} L=K(\alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,\alpha_{n}) \subseteq E {}$ with ${} \alpha_{i} \in E {}$ be a finitely generated
