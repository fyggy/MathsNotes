We have that ${} F =K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\cong K((X_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$. Then ${} F=Q(K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}]) {}$. Now the set of all monomials, ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$, is a basis of ${} F'=K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Consider ${} g \in F'[(Y_{j})_{j \in J}] {}$ defined by
$$
g((Y_{j})_{j \in J})=\sum _{j \in J}M_{j} Y_{j}
$$
Suppose that $g$
