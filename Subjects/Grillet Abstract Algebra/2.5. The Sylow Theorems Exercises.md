1. 
If ${} |G|=pk {}$ for some prime ${} p$ and some $k$, then
$$
G=G_{1}\oplus G_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus G_{n}
$$
and so ${} |G| {}$ is the product of ${} |G_{i}| {}$. Therefore, we have some $i$ such that ${} |G_{i}|=p^{m} {}$, where ${} G_{i} {}$ is cyclic. Therefore, we have a subgroup of ${} G_{i}$ of order $p {}$
2. 
Suppose ${} |G|=p_{1}^{k_{1}}\dots p_{n}^{k_{n}} {}$. Then ${} G=G_{1} \oplus  \dots \oplus G_{m} {}$. Now set ${} H_{p_{i}} {}$ to be the product of all ${} G_{i} {}$ such that ${} p_{i}$ divides their order. If ${} d \mid |G| {}$, 

First, suppose that ${} |G|=p^{k} {}$ for some prime $p$. Then ${} G=G_{1} \oplus  \dots \oplus  G_{m} {}$, where ${} p\mid |G_{i}| {}$. Now if ${} d \mid |G| {}$, if ${} m=1 {}$, then $G$ is cyclic, and so has a subgroup of order $d$. Otherwise,
