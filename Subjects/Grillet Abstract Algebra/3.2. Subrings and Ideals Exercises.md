1. 
Let $R$ be a ring, and let ${} \mathcal{A}=(A_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be a family of subrings of ${} R {}$. Then ${} \bigcap \mathcal{A} {}$ is an abelian subgroup of $R$ containing $1$. Now if ${} x,\, y,\, z \in \bigcap \mathcal{A} {}$, then ${} x,\, y,\, z \in A_{i} {}$ for all ${} i \in I {}$, so ${} xy \in A_{i} {}$ and ${} (xy)z=x(yz) {}$ in ${} A_{i} {}$, so ${} xy \in \bigcap \mathcal{A} {}$ and multiplication is commutative.

Let ${} \mathcal{A}=(A_{i})_{i=I} {}$ be a directed family of subrings of a ring ${} R {}$. Now ${} \bigcup \mathcal{A} {}$ is an abelian subgroup of ${} R {}$ containing $1$. Now if ${} x,\, y,\, z \in \bigcup \mathcal{A} {}$, then there exists some ${} i,\, j,\, k \in I {}$ such that ${} x \in A_{i},\, y \in A_{j},\, z \in A_{k} {}$. Therefore, there is some ${} \ell \in I {}$ such that ${} A_{i},\, A_{j},\, A_{k} \subseteq A_{\ell} {}$. Therefore, ${} xy \in A_{\ell} {}$, and ${} (xy)z=x(yz) {}$, and ${} \bigcup \mathcal{A} {}$ is a subring

Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Now let $N {}$ be the set of all nilpotent elements. First note that if ${} x,\, y \in N {}$, then we have ${} a,\, b {}$ such that ${} x^{a}=0=y^{b} {}$. Now 
$$
\begin{align}
 (x+y)^{a+b} & =\sum_{i=0}^{a+b} \binom{a+b}{i} x^{i} y^{a+b-i}  \\
 & = \sum_{i=0}^{a} \binom{a+b}{i} x^{i}y^{a+b-i}+\sum_{i=a+1}^{a+b} \binom{a+b}{i} x^{i}y^{a+b-i} \\
 & =0
 \end{align}
$$
so ${} x+y \in N {}$. Furthermore, if ${} x \in N {}$ with degree $k {}$, then ${} ( -x )^{k}=(-1)^{k}x^{k}=0 {}$, so ${} -x \in N {}$. Finally, ${} 0^{1}=0 {}$, so ${} 0 \in N {}$. Therefore, $N$ is an abelian subgroup of $R$. Now if ${} x \in N {}$ with degree $k {}$ and ${} y \in R {}$, then 
$$
(xy)^{k}=x^{k}y^{k}=0=y^{k}x^{k}=(yx)^{k}
$$
so ${} xy,\, yx \in N {}$. Therefore, $N$ is an ideal.

Suppose that $J$ is an ideal of $R$ with $J \geq I {}$. Then if ${} p \in J {}$, suppose that $p$ has nonzero constant term. Then ${} qp \in J {}$, where $q$ is a real constant. Therefore, $J$ has a polynomial with a constant term for every ${} x \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Now since
