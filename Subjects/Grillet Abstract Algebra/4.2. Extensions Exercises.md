1. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E {}$ be a field extension. Then let
$$
A=\{K(S) \mid S \subseteq E \setminus K,\, \aleph(S)<\aleph_{0} \}
$$
Now for any pair of fields $K(S),\, K(T) {}$, then ${} S \cup T {}$ is finite, and so ${} K(S),\, K(T) \subseteq K(S \cup T) \in A {}$. Therefore, ${} A$ is a directed family. Furthermore, 
$$
\bigcup A=E
$$
as any element $x {}$ in ${} E$ is contained in some field ${} K(x) \in A {}$.

 Let $\alpha$ be transcendental over $K$. Let $\psi:K(\alpha)\to{}L {}$ be a field homomorphism. Then suppose that ${} f \in L[X] {}$ is a polynomial such that ${} f(\psi(\alpha)) {}$=0.
