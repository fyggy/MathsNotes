Let ${} K \subseteq E {}$ be a field extension. Then let
$$
A=\{K(S) \mid S \subseteq E \setminus K,\, \aleph(S)<\aleph_{0} \}
$$
Now for any pair of fields $K(S),\, K(T) {}$, then ${} S \cup T {}$ is finite, and so ${} K(S),\, K(T) \subseteq K(S \cup T) \in A {}$. Therefore, ${} A$ is a directed family. Furthermore, 
$$
\bigcup A=E
$$
as any element $x {}$ in ${} E$ is contained in some field ${} K(x) \in A {}$.

 Let $\alpha$ be transcendental over $K$. Let $\psi:K(\alpha)\to{}L {}$ be a field homomorphism. Then suppose that ${} f \in \psi(K)[X] {}$ is a polynomial such that ${} f(\psi(\alpha))=0 {}$. Then for each coefficient ${} a_{i} {}$ of ${} f$, there exists some ${} b_{i} \in K {}$ such that ${} \psi(b_{ i})=a_{i} {}$, and so there exists some ${} \tilde{f} \in K[X] {}$ such that ${} f=^{\psi}\tilde{f} {}$. Then ${} 0=f(\psi(\alpha))=^{\psi} \tilde{f}(\psi(\alpha))=\psi(\tilde{f}(\alpha)) {}$ and so since $\psi$ is a field homomorphism it is injective, and ${} \tilde{f}(\alpha)=0 {}$. This is a contradiction, therefore, $\psi(\alpha) {}$ is transcendental over ${} \psi(K) {}$

 Conversely, let ${} \varphi :K\to{}L {}$ be a field homomorphism, and let ${} \beta \in L {}$ be transcendental over ${} \varphi(K) {}$, and $\alpha$ transcendental over $K {}$. Since $\alpha {}$ is transcendental,Therefore, every element of ${} K(\alpha) {}$ is a quotient of unique polynomials ${} f,\, g \in K[X] {}$ evaluated at $\alpha {}$. Let 
$$
\begin{align}
 \psi:K(\alpha)  & \to{} L  \\
 f(\alpha) / g(\alpha)&  \mapsto {}^{\varphi}f(\beta) / {}^{\varphi}g(\beta)
 \end{align}
$$
