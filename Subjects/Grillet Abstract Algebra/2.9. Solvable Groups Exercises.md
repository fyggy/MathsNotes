3. 
The factors of ${} D_{n} {}$ are ${} C_{n} {}$ and $C_{2}$, which are both abelian. Therefore, ${} D_{n}$ is solvable. 
4. 
Since every group of order less than ${} 60 {}$ may only have abelian composition factors, then they are solvable. 
5. 
Let $\eta {}$ be an endomorphism of $G$. Now let ${} G'=\langle \{ xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \mid x,\, y \in G \} \rangle  {}$. Now if ${} c=xyx^{-1}y^{-1} {}$, then
$$
\eta c=\eta (x) \eta (y) \eta (x)^{-1} \eta(y)^{-1} \in  G'
$$
so all the generators of $G' {}$ are invariant under ${} \eta {}$. 
6. 
We proceed by induction. Let ${} c=xyx^{-1}y^{-1} {}$, with ${} x,\, y \in G^{(k)} {}$. Now ${} \eta(x),\, \eta(y) \in G^{(k)} {}$ by hypothesis
$$
\eta c=\eta (x) \eta (y) \eta (x)^{-1} \eta(y)^{-1} \in  G^{(k+1)}
$$
and so all the generators of ${} G^{(k+1)} {}$ are invariant under ${} \eta {}$
7. 
Let $A {}$ be an abelian group, and let ${} \varphi:G \to{}A {}$ a homomorphism. Let ${} x,\, y \in G {}$. Then 
$$
\varphi(xyx^{-1}y^{-1})=\varphi(x)\varphi(y)(\varphi(y)\varphi(x))^{-1}=\varphi(x)\varphi(y)(\varphi(x)\varphi(y))^{-1}=1
$$
so ${} xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in  \ker  \varphi {}$. Therefore, the generators of $G' {}$ are contained in ${} \ker \varphi {}$, so $\varphi$ factors uniquely through ${} G /G' {}$.

Conversely, if $H {}$ is a normal subgroup such that for all homomorphisms ${} \varphi:G\to{}A {}$ with $A$ abelian, then ${} \varphi = \psi \circ  \pi {}$ for some unique ${} \psi {}$, then ${} G / G' {}$ is abelian with a canonical homomorphism ${} \tau {}$. Now ${} \tau = \psi \circ  \pi {}$ for some unique $\psi {}$.
