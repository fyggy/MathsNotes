1. 
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a chain of algebraically independent subsets of ${} E \supseteq K {}$. Let ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be the union of $\mathcal{C}$. Now let ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Then ${} f \in K[(X_{j})_{j \in J}] {}$, where $J {}$ is a finite subset of $I$. Therefore, there exists a ${} (\beta_{\ell})_{\ell \in L}  \in \mathcal{C} {}$ such that ${} (\alpha_{j})_{j \in J} \subseteq (\beta_{\ell})_{\ell \in L} {}$, and since the ${} \beta_{\ell}$ are algebraically independent, then ${} f((\alpha_{i})_{i \in I})=f((\alpha_{j})_{j \in J})=0 {}$ iff ${} f=0 {}$, and the ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are algebraically independent.

Let $S$ be algebraically independent over $K$, and let $\beta$ be transcendental over $K(S)$. Then let ${} T=S \cup \{ \beta \} {}$, and let ${} f \in K[(X_{t})_{t \in T}] {}$ be non-zero. Then ${} f \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}][X_{\beta}] {}$, and so 
$$
f(T)=\sum _{i =0}^{n} f_{i}(S)\beta^{i}
$$
where ${} f_{i} \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}] {}$. Since $S$ is algebraically independent, and not all ${} f_{i}=0 {}$, then not all ${} f_{i}(S)=0 {}$, and so 
$$
f(T)=\tilde{f}(\beta)
$$
where ${} \tilde{f} \in K[X_{\beta}] {}$. Now since the ${} f_{i}(S) \in K(S) {}$, and $\beta$ is transcendental over $K(S)$, and ${} \tilde{f}\neq 0 {}$, then ${} f(T)=\tilde{f}(\beta)\neq 0 {}$. Therefore, $T$ is algebraically independent over $K$.

Let $S {}$ be algebraically independent over ${} K {}$, and let ${} \beta \in S {}$. Then
