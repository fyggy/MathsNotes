Let $G$ be a group with ${} |G|=n {}$, and let ${} g \in G {}$ with ${} |g|=k {}$. Note that the minimum size of the centraliser may be $k$, as $g$ commutes with ${} g^{m}$ for all $m$. Therefore, the maximum size of it's conjugacy class is the index of the centraliser, ${} n /k {}$.

Let $G$ such that $G/Z(G) {}$ is cyclic. Then there exists some element ${} a \in G {}$ so that we have ${} G / Z(G)=\langle aZ(G) \rangle  {}$. Let ${} Z=Z(G) {}$, and let ${} x \in G {}$. Now ${} x \in a^{k}Z {}$, so, ${} x=a^{k}y=ya^{k} {}$ for some ${} y \in Z {}$. Therefore, ${} ax=a^{k+1}y=ya^{k+1}=xa {}$, and so ${} a \in Z {}$, so ${} \langle aZ \rangle =\langle Z \rangle =1 {}$, and ${} G/Z(G)=1 {}$, so ${} G = Z(G) {}$ and $G$ is abelian.

Let $\alpha:G\to{}G {}$ be an automorphism of $G$
