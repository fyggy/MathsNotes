11. 
Let $G$ be a group with ${} |G|=n {}$, and let ${} g \in G {}$ with ${} |g|=k {}$. Note that the minimum size of the centraliser may be $k$, as $g$ commutes with ${} g^{m}$ for all $m$. Therefore, the maximum size of it's conjugacy class is the index of the centraliser, ${} n /k {}$. 
12. 
Let $G$ such that $G/Z(G) {}$ is cyclic. Then there exists some element ${} a \in G {}$ so that we have ${} G / Z(G)=\langle aZ(G) \rangle  {}$. Let ${} Z=Z(G) {}$. Let ${} x \in G {}$. Then ${} ax \in a^{k}Z {}$, so ${} x \in a^{k-1}Z {}$ and ${} xa \in a^{k}Z {}$. Now ${} ax=a^{k}y {}$ and ${} xa=a^{k}z {}$ for some ${} y,\, z \in Z {}$, so $$
