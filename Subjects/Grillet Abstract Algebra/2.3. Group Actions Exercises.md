11. 
Let $G$ be a group with ${} |G|=n {}$, and let ${} g \in G {}$ with ${} |g|=k {}$. Note that the minimum size of the centraliser may be $k$, as $g$ commutes with ${} g^{m}$ for all $m$. Therefore, the maximum size of it's conjugacy class is the index of the centraliser, ${} n /k {}$. 
12. 
Let $G$ such that $G/Z(G) {}$ is cyclic. Then there exists some ${} a \in G {}$ such that for ${} aZ=aZ(G) {}$, ${} \langle aZ \rangle=G /Z  {}$
