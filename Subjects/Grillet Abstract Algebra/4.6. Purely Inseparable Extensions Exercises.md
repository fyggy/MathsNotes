Let ${} \alpha \in \conj{K} {}$. Suppose that ${} \alpha \in K^{1 /p^{\infty }} {}$, and let $\sigma$ be a $K$-automorphism of ${} \conj{K} {}$. Then ${} \alpha^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for some minimal ${} m {}$, and so ${} \sigma(\alpha)^{p^{m}}=\sigma(\alpha^{p^{m}})=\alpha^{p^{m}} {}$. Since ${} {p^{m}}^{\text{th}} {}$ roots are unique, then this implies that $\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha {}$.

Now suppose that, for every ${} K {}$-automorphism $\sigma$ of ${} \conj{K}$, ${} \sigma(\alpha)=\alpha {}$. 

Now suppose that $\alpha \notin K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$. Then $\alpha$
