Suppose that $K$ is algebraically closed and finite. Then ${} \Char K>0 {}$, and so, by proposition III.8.13, $K[X]$ contains infinitely many monic irreducible polynomials. However, these cannot all be polynomials of degree $1$, as there are only finitely many of those. Therefore, there must be irreducible polynomials without degree $1$, which contradicts the algebraic closure of $K$. 
3. 
Let ${} f \in A[X] {}$ be non-constant. Suppose that ${} \deg f=2 {}$ or ${} \deg f=3. {}$ Now the quadratic and cubic formulae respectively give a formula in radicals from the coefficients of ${} f$ for a root of $f {}$. Therefore, the results of these formulae give algebraic solutions only, and so $f$ and $g$ have a root in $A$. Otherwise, suppose that ${} \deg f\geq 4 {}$. Then
