#### Example:
Let ${} f:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ defined by ${} f(x,\, y)=x^{2}+y^{2} {}$. The graph of $f$ is going to be a $2$ dimensional subset of $3$ dimensional space, called a paraboloid
#### Example:
${} \vec{f}:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ or $\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. The graph of $f$ gives a curve in $2$ dimensional or $3$ dimensional space
#### Example:
${} \vec{f}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ defined by ${} \vec{f}(x,\, y)=(-y,\, x) {}$ associates a vector to every point of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.
## Vector Valued Real functions
### Curves, Paths and Parameterisations
A *curve* in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a one-dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ :3. (It's a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which looks like a twisted piece of $\mathbb{R}$)
#### Example
The graph of $f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is the set ${} \{ (x,\, f(x))\mid x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subseteq  \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$.

We can also imagine the curve in 3 dimensional space
#### Example: (warning)
Not all curves are graphs of functions. Consider a circle:

This is clearly not a graph of a function

Another way to describe a circle
