# Preliminaries
## What is...
### Probability
#### History
Pascal and Fermat "started" (by a western perspective of started) probability in 1654 by conversing about 2 problems
1. The dice problem:
Roll 2 fair dice. How many *throws* before ${} \mathbb{P}(\text{rolling 6-6})\geq \frac{1}{2} {}$.
Answer: the change of not rolling 6-6 is ${} 35/36 {}$, so the change of not rolling 6-6 for k rounds is ${} 1-(35 / 36)^{k} {}$
2. The division problem/ the problem of points
Flip a coin repeatedly, if it's heads, then player A gets a point, and if it's tails, then B gets a point. You need 10 points to win, and there are Â£80 staked. If the game is interrupted while A has ${} a$ points and B has $b$ points, then how should the money be divided between the 2 of them that reflects their chance of winning.

##### Pascal's solution:
$A$ needs ${} 10-a {}$ points, and $B$ needs ${} 10-b {}$ points, so the game must have ended in ${} 19-a-b {}$ rounds. I'm not writigh all this shit out but it's pascals triangle stuff
