Let $E$ be a vector space, and let ${} F \subseteq E_{1} \subseteq E {}$ be subspaces. Let ${} \pi_{E_{1}}:E\to{}E/E_{1} {}$ and ${} \pi_{F}:E\to{}E / F {}$ be the projection mappings. Since ${} \ker \pi_{F}=F \subseteq  E_{1} \ker \pi_{E_{1}} {}$ there exists a mapping ${} \varphi: E /F \to{}E / E_{1} {}$ with ${} \varphi \circ \pi_{F}=\pi_{E_{1}} {}$. Since $\pi_{E_{1}}$ is surjective, then $\varphi$ is surjective. 

Now let ${} x \in \ker  \varphi {}$. Then there exists a ${} e \in E {}$ with ${} \pi_{F}(e)=x {}$, and ${} \pi_{E_{1}}(e)=1 {}$, so ${} e \in E_{1} {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in E_{1} /F {}$. Now let ${} x \in E_{1} /F {}$. Then there exists a ${} e \in E_{1} {}$ with ${} \pi_{F}(e)=x {}$. Then ${} \pi_{E_{1}}(e)=1 {}$, so ${} \varphi(\pi_{F}(e))=\varphi(x)=1 {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in \ker \varphi {}$, and ${} \ker \varphi=E_{1} /F {}$.

Now we may factor $\varphi$ into ${} \varphi=\pi \circ  \theta {}$, where ${} \pi : E /F \to{} (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) {}$ is the surjective projective map, and ${} \theta : (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) \to{} E /E_{1} {}$ is the injection. Since $\varphi$ is surjective, then so is $\theta$, so $\theta$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, ${} (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) \cong  E /E_{1} {}$.

Let ${} \chi: E /E_{1} \to{}E {}$ be a linear map which splits the sequence, i.e. ${} \pi \circ  \chi =\iota {}$. Let ${} \mathcal{C} {}$ be the set of subspaces of ${} E {}$. Let ${} \mathcal{X} {}$ be the set of splitting linear maps of the above form. Let ${} f:\mathcal{X} \to{} \mathcal{C} {}$ map ${} \chi \mapsto \im  \chi {}$. Note that if ${} x \in f(\chi) \cap E_{1} {}$, then there exists a ${} \bar{x} \in E /E_{1} {}$ with ${} \chi(\bar{x})=x {}$. Therefore, ${} \pi(x)=\pi(\chi(\bar{x}))=\bar{x} {}$. But ${} x \in E_{1} {}$, so ${} \pi(x)=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} \bar{x}=0 {}$, and ${} x=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} f(\chi)\cap E_{1}=\mathbf{0} {}$. 

Now let ${} a \in E {}$. Then ${} \pi(a- \chi(\pi(a)))=\pi(a)-\pi(a)=0 {}$, so ${} a-\chi \pi a \in E_{1} {}$. Therefore, there exists some ${} e_{1} \in E_{1} {}$ and some ${} e_{2} \in f(\chi)=\im \chi {}$ with ${} a=e_{1}+e_{2} {}$, so ${} E=E_{1} + \im \chi {}$, so ${} E=E_{1}\oplus \im \chi. {}$ Therefore, $f(\chi)$ is a complementary subspace of $E_{1}$.

Suppose that ${} \chi,\, \chi' \in \mathcal{X} {}$ with ${} f(\chi)=f(\chi') {}$. Note that $\chi$ is injective; in particular, suppose that ${} x,\, y \in E /E_{1} {}$ with ${} \chi(x)=\chi(y) {}$. Then ${} x=\pi \chi x=\pi\chi y=y  {}$. By similar reasoning, $\chi' {}$ is injective. Now let ${} x \in E /E_{1} {}$. Then there exists a unique ${} x' \in \im \chi' {}$ with ${} \chi(x)=\chi'(x') {}$. Therefore, ${} x=\pi\chi x=\pi\chi x'=x' {}$, so ${} \chi=\chi' {}$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.

Now let ${} E_{2} \in \mathcal{C} {}$ be a subspace with ${} E_{1} \oplus E_{2}=E {}$. Let ${} \chi:E /E_{1} \to{}E {}$ be defined by, given an element ${} x=e_{1}+e_{2} \in E,\, e_{1} \in E_{1},\, e_{2} \in E_{2} {}$, we have ${} \pi x=\pi e_{2}  {}$, so ${} \chi \pi x=e_{2} {}$. Now this is well defined and linear, as the representation is unique. Now $\im \chi=E_{2} {}$. Therefore, ${} \im f {}$ is a subset of the set of complementary subspaces. Since every ${} f(\chi) {}$ is a complementary subspace, then $\im f$ *is* the set of complementary subspaces. Therefore, ${} f': \mathcal{X}\to{}\im f {}$ is a bijection between splitting maps and complementary subspaces of $E_{1} {}$.

Suppose there exists a linear map ${} \omega: E \to{}F {}$ with ${} \omega \circ  \varphi = \iota {}$. Let ${} e \in E {}$. Then ${} \omega(e-\varphi\omega e)=\omega e {}-\omega e=0 {}$, so ${} e-\varphi\omega e \in \ker \omega {}$. Therefore, we have ${} e-\varphi\omega e=k \in \ker \omega {}$ and ${} \varphi \omega e=m \in \im \varphi {}$ with ${} m+k=e {}$ for all ${} e \in E {}$. Therefore, ${} E=\im \varphi + \ker  \omega {}$. 

Now let ${} e \in  {}$. Let ${} f \in F {}$ with ${} \varphi f \in \im \varphi {}$. Now if ${} \varphi f \in \ker  \omega {}$, then ${} \omega\varphi f =f=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} \varphi f=0, {}$ and $\im  \varphi \cap \ker  \omega=\mathbf{0} {}$. Therefore, ${} E = \im \varphi \oplus  \ker  \omega {}$. 

Now let ${} e \in E {}$. There exist unique ${} k \in \ker \omega {}$ and ${} m \in \im \varphi {}$ with ${} e=m+k {}$. Then ${} m \in \ker  \psi {}$, so ${} \psi e=\psi k {}$. Suppose we have ${} k' \in \ker \omega {}$ with ${} \psi k=\psi k'=\psi e {}$. Then ${} \psi(e-k')=\psi k-\psi k'=0 {}$, so ${} e-k' \in \ker \psi=\im \varphi {}$. Now we have ${} m'=e-k' {}$ with ${} e=m'+k' {}$. Therefore, ${} m'=m {}$ and ${} k'=k. {}$ Therefore, for all ${} e \in E {}$, there exists some unique ${} k \in \ker \omega {}$ with ${} \psi e=\psi k {}$. Therefore, since $\psi {}$ is surjective, then given ${} g \in G {}$, there exists some unique ${} k \in \ker \omega {}$ with ${} \psi k=g {}$. Now let ${} \chi:G \to{} E {}$ with ${} \chi(g)=\chi \psi k=k {}$. This is well defined via above, and is clearly linear. 

Now let ${} g \in G {}$. By above, there exists a unique ${} k \in \ker \omega {}$ with ${} \psi k=g {}$. Now ${} \psi\chi g=\psi\chi \psi k=\psi k=g {}$, so ${} \psi \circ  \chi=\iota {}$, so the sequence is split. Now let ${} e \in \im \chi {}$. Clearly, ${} e \in \ker  \omega,$ so ${} \im \chi=\ker \omega {}$, so the sequence
$$
0 \leftarrow F \xleftarrow{\omega} E \xleftarrow{\chi} G \leftarrow 0
$$
is exact. 

Conversely, suppose there exists a linear map ${} \chi :G \to{}E {}$ with ${} \psi \circ  \chi =\iota {}$. We showed above that this corresponds to a complementary subspace $\im \chi$ of ${} F=\ker \psi=\im \varphi {}$, so ${} E=\im \chi \oplus  \ker \psi {}$. Now let ${} e \in E {}$. Then there exists some ${} m \in \im \chi {}$ and ${} k \in \ker \psi=\im \varphi {}$. Now we have some ${} f \in F {}$ with ${} \varphi f=k {}$. We have that $f {}$ is unique, as ${} \varphi {}$ is injective. Now let ${} \omega e=\omega k=\omega\varphi f=f {}$. This is well defined by above, and clearly linear, and we have ${} \omega \circ  \varphi=\iota {}$, as required. Finally, if ${} \omega e=0 {}$, then ${} \omega e=\omega(m+k)=\omega k=0 {}$. Since $\varphi$ is injective, then ${} k=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} e=m \in \im  \chi {}$, so the sequence
$$
0 \leftarrow F \xleftarrow{\omega} E \xleftarrow{\chi} G \leftarrow 0
$$
is exact.
