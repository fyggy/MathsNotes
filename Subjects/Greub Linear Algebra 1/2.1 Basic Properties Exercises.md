7. b)
Let $E$ be a vector space, and let ${} F \subseteq E_{1} \subseteq E {}$ be subspaces. Let ${} \pi_{E_{1}}:E\to{}E/E_{1} {}$ and ${} \pi_{F}:E\to{}E / F {}$ be the projection mappings. Since ${} \ker \pi_{F}=F \subseteq  E_{1} \ker \pi_{E_{1}} {}$ there exists a mapping ${} \varphi: E /F \to{}E / E_{1} {}$ with ${} \varphi \circ \pi_{F}=\pi_{E_{1}} {}$. Since $\pi_{E_{1}}$ is surjective, then $\varphi$ is surjective. 

Now let ${} x \in \ker  \varphi {}$. Then there exists a ${} e \in E {}$ with ${} \pi_{F}(e)=x {}$, and ${} \pi_{E_{1}}(e)=1 {}$, so ${} e \in E_{1} {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in E_{1} /F {}$. Now let ${} x \in E_{1} /F {}$. Then there exists a ${} e \in E_{1} {}$ with ${} \pi_{F}(e)=x {}$. Then ${} \pi_{E_{1}}(e)=1 {}$, so ${} \varphi(\pi_{F}(e))=\varphi(x)=1 {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in \ker \varphi {}$, and ${} \ker \varphi=E_{1} /F {}$.

Now we may factor $\varphi$ into ${} \varphi=\pi \circ  \theta {}$, where ${} \pi : E /F \to{} (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) {}$ is the surjective projective map, and ${} \theta : (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) \to{} E /E_{1} {}$ is the injection. Since $\varphi$ is surjective, then so is $\theta$, so $\theta$ is an isomorphism. Therefore, ${} (E /F) / (E_{1} /F) \cong  E /E_{1} {}$.

Let ${} \chi: E /E_{1} \to{}E {}$ be a linear map which splits the sequence, i.e. ${} \pi \circ  \chi =\iota {}$. Let ${} \mathcal{C} {}$ be the set of subspaces of ${} E {}$. Let ${} \mathcal{X} {}$ be the set of splitting linear maps of the above form. Let ${} f:\mathcal{X} \to{} \mathcal{C} {}$ map ${} \chi \mapsto \im  \chi {}$. Note that if ${} x \in f(\chi) \cap E_{1} {}$, then there exists a ${} \bar{x} \in E /E_{1} {}$ with ${} \chi(\bar{x})=x {}$. Therefore, ${} \pi(x)=\pi(\chi(\bar{x}))=\bar{x} {}$. But ${} x \in E_{1} {}$, so ${} \pi(x)=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} \bar{x}=0 {}$, and ${} x=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} f(\chi)\cap E_{1}=\mathbf{0} {}$. 

Now let ${} a \in E {}$. Then ${} \pi(a- \chi(\pi(a)))=\pi(a)-\pi(a)=0 {}$, so ${} a-\chi \pi a \in E_{1} {}$. Therefore, there exists some ${} e_{1} \in E_{1} {}$ and some ${} e_{2} \in f(\chi)=\im \chi {}$ with ${} a=e_{1}+e_{2} {}$, so ${} E=E_{1} + \im \chi {}$, so ${} E=E_{1}\oplus \im \chi. {}$ Therefore, $f(\chi)$ is a complementary subspace of $E_{1}$.

Suppose that ${} \chi,\, \chi' \in \mathcal{X} {}$ with ${} f(\chi)=f(\chi') {}$. Note that $\chi$ is injective; in particular, suppose that ${} x,\, y \in E /E_{1} {}$ with ${} \chi(x)=\chi(y) {}$. Then ${} x=\pi \chi x=\pi\chi y=y  {}$. By similar reasoning, $\chi' {}$ is injective. Now let ${} x \in E /E_{1} {}$. Then there exists a unique ${} x' \in \im \chi' {}$ with ${} \chi(x)=\chi'(x') {}$. Therefore, ${} x=\pi\chi x=\pi\chi x'=x' {}$, so ${} \chi=\chi' {}$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.

Now let ${} E_{2} \in \mathcal{C} {}$ be a subspace with ${} E_{1} \oplus E_{2}=E {}$. Let ${} \chi:E /E_{1} \to{}E {}$ be defined by, given an element ${} x=e_{1}+e_{2} \in E,\, e_{1} \in E_{1},\, e_{2} \in E_{2} {}$, we have ${} \pi x=\pi e_{2}  {}$, so ${} \chi \pi x=e_{2} {}$. Now this is well defined and linear, as the representation is unique. Now $\im \chi=E_{2} {}$. Therefore, ${} \im f {}$ is a subset of the set of complementary subspaces. Since every ${} f(\chi) {}$ is a complementary subspace, then $\im f$ *is* the set of complementary subspaces. Therefore, ${} f': \mathcal{X}\to{}\im f {}$ is a bijection between splitting maps and complementary subspaces of $E_{1}$.
