1. 
Let ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a lie algebra over a algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Let ${} \mathfrak{B}\subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable proper subalgebra of dimension $m {}$. Let $\mathfrak{M} {}$ be a subalgebra of ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ such that ${} \mathfrak{B} \subset \mathfrak{M} {}$ is proper, and ${} \dim \mathfrak{M} {}$ is minimal.
