Let ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a lie algebra over a algebraically closed field $\Gamma$of characteristic 0. Let ${} \mathfrak{B}\subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable proper subalgebra of dimension $m {}$. We work by induction on the dimension of ${} \mathfrak{B}$. Let ${} \mathfrak{A} \subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a proper subalgebra, and let ${} \dim \mathfrak{B}=0 {}$. Now there exists some ${} K \in \mathfrak{L},\, K \notin \mathfrak{A} {}$. Let ${} \mathfrak{S}=K\Gamma {}$ be the $1 {}$ dimensional subspace spanned by ${} K {}$. Now ${} \mathfrak{S} \cap \mathfrak{A}=0 {}$, and ${} \mathfrak{B} \subset \mathfrak{S} {}$ with ${} \dim \mathfrak{S}=1=\dim \mathfrak{B}+1 {}$.

Now by induction suppose that if ${} \mathfrak{B} {}$ is solvable and ${} \dim \mathfrak{B}=m {}$, then given a proper subalgebra ${} \mathfrak{A}\subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ there exists some ${} \mathfrak{S}$ with ${} \mathfrak{S} \cap \mathfrak{A}=0 {}$ and
