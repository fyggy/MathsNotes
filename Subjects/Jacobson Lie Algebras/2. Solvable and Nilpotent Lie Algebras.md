1. 
Let ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a lie algebra over a algebraically closed field ${} \Phi {}$ of characteristic 0. Let ${} \mathfrak{B}\subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable proper subalgebra of dimension $m {}$. Consider ${} \mathfrak{L} / \mathfrak{B} {}$. Then $\ad \mathfrak{B} {}$ induces a system of linear transformations, ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$ of ${} \mathfrak{L} /\mathfrak{B}=\bar{\mathfrak{L}} {}$. Now $\ad \mathfrak{B}$ is solvable, so ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$ is solvable. Therefore, there exists some vector ${} x \in \bar{\mathfrak{L}} {}$ with ${} \conj{\ad B}  \in \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}},\, (\bar{\ad B})x=\alpha x {}$, for all ${} B \in \mathfrak{B} {}$, that is, $x$ is an eigenvector for all of ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$. Now ${} x \Phi=\span\{x\} {}$ is irreducible under ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$. Therefore, there exists some ${} \mathfrak{M} \subseteq \mathfrak{L} {}$ with ${} \mathfrak{B} \subseteq  \mathfrak{M} {}$ and ${} \mathfrak{M} / \mathfrak{B} \cong  x\Phi {}$. Since ${} \dim x\Phi=1 {}$, then ${} \dim \mathfrak{M}=m+1 {}$, as required.

Let ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable subalgebra of ${} \Phi^{n}_{L} {}$. Then there exists a basis of $\mathfrak{L}$ such that every element of $\mathfrak{L}$ is in triangular form. Therefore, there are at most ${} n(n+1)/2 {}$ independent variables, so ${} \dim \mathfrak{L} \leq n(n+1) /2 {}$. 

Now consider the subalgebra $\mathfrak{R} {}$ consisting of all upper triangular matrices. This is solvable. Now let ${} Q \in \Phi^{n} {}$ be the invertible matrix such that ${} Q^{-1}\mathfrak{L}Q {}$ is in triangular form. Now this is clearly a subalgebra of ${} \mathfrak{R}$, so ${} \mathfrak{L} \subseteq Q^{-1}\mathfrak{R} {}$, and so $\mathfrak{L} {}$ is contained in a solvable subalgebra of dimension ${} n(n+1) /2 {}$.

Let $\mathfrak{L}_{1} {}$ and $\mathfrak{L}_{2}$ be solvable subalgebras of dimension ${} n(n+1) / 2 {}$. Then there exist 2 regular matrices ${} P,\, Q {}$ such that ${} P^{-1}\mathfrak{L}_{1} P=\mathfrak{R}=Q^{-1}\mathfrak{L}_{2}Q {}$. Now we have 
$$
PQ^{-1}\mathfrak{L}_{2} (PQ^{-1})^{-1}=\mathfrak{L}_{1}
$$
Setting ${} A=PQ^{-1} {}$, we get our solution.

Let ${} \Phi {}$ be algebraically closed, and let ${} \mathfrak{L}$ be a Lie algebra over $\Phi {}$ which is *not* nilpotent. Now note that every element of $\ad \mathfrak{L}$ has an eigenvector. Since $\ad \mathfrak{L}$ is not nilpotent, then there exists some element ${} f \in \mathfrak{L} {}$ which is not nilpotent. Therefore, ${} \ad f {}$ has a nonzero eigenvalue $\alpha {}$ associated with an eigenvector ${} e {}$. Note that $e {}$ and $f {}$ are linearly independent, as otherwise ${} e=\beta f {}$ ${} \ad (f)(\beta f)=0 {}$ has a eigenvalue of ${} 0$. Now
$$
[e,\, f]=\alpha e
$$
and the subalgebra spanned by ${} e,\, f {}$ is 2 dimensional and non-abelian.
5. 
Let $\Phi$ be an algebraically closed field. Let ${} \mathfrak{A} {}$ be a non-associative algebra, and let ${} A \in GL(\mathfrak{A}) {}$. Now
$$
\mathfrak{A}=\bigoplus_{\substack{\alpha \text{ is an}\\\text{ eigenvalue}} }\mathfrak{M}_{\alpha}
$$
Let $\chi {}$ be the characteristic polynomial of ${} A {}$, and let ${} \alpha,\, \beta \in \sigma(A) {}$, the spectrum of $A$. Now let ${} z \in \mathfrak{A}_{\alpha}\mathfrak{A}_{\beta}=\{ xy \mid \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}:(A-\alpha I)^{k}x=0,\, (A-\beta I)^{k}y=0 \} {}$. Note that 
$$
Az=(Ax)(Ay)
