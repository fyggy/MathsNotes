1. 
Let ${} \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a lie algebra over a algebraically closed field ${} \Phi {}$ of characteristic 0. Let ${} \mathfrak{B}\subset \mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable proper subalgebra of dimension $m {}$. Consider ${} \mathfrak{L} / \mathfrak{B} {}$. Then $\ad \mathfrak{B} {}$ induces a system of linear transformations, ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$ of ${} \mathfrak{L} /\mathfrak{B}=\bar{\mathfrak{L}} {}$. Now $\ad \mathfrak{B}$ is solvable, so ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$ is solvable. Therefore, there exists some vector ${} x \in \bar{\mathfrak{L}} {}$ with ${} \conj{\ad B}  \in \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}},\, (\bar{\ad B})x=\alpha x {}$, for all ${} B \in \mathfrak{B} {}$, that is, $x$ is an eigenvector for all of ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$. Now ${} x \Phi=\span\{x\} {}$ is irreducible under ${} \bar{\ad \mathfrak{B}} {}$. Therefore, there exists some ${} \mathfrak{M} \subseteq \mathfrak{L} {}$ with ${} \mathfrak{B} \subseteq  \mathfrak{M} {}$ and ${} \mathfrak{M} / \mathfrak{B} \cong  x\Phi {}$. Since ${} \dim x\Phi=1 {}$, then ${} \dim \mathfrak{M}=m+1 {}$, as required.

Let $\mathfrak{L} {}$ be a solvable subalgebra of ${} \Phi^{n}_{L} {}$. Then there exists a basis of $\mathfrak{L}$ such that every element of $\mathfrak{L}$ is in triangular form. Therefore, there are at most ${} n(n+1)/2 {}$ independent variables, so ${} \dim \mathfrak{L} \leq n(n+1) /2 {}$. 

Now consider the subalgebra consisting of all triangular matrices.
