# Quantifiers, Negations, Converses, Contrapositives
## Quantifiers
### Examples
1. consider the statement:
$$
\forall x >0 \quad \exists  y \in \mathbb{Q} \quad \text{ such that } \quad 0<y<x
$$
This is true. Its a wee bit fiddly to prove though, as we need to pick $y$ to be rational

We will pick y to be of the form $1/n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$
we know: $x>0$
We want: $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that ${1}/{n}<x$

$$
\frac{1}{n}<x \iff \frac{1}{x}<n
$$
So let $\displaystyle n=\ceil*{\frac{1}{x}}+1$. We add 1 just in case $1/x$ is already an integer

Then $\displaystyle \frac{1}{n}<x$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$
So if $\displaystyle y =\frac{1}{n}$, we have found $y \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $0<y<x\quad \square.$
### Order matters
Consider the statement:
$$
\exists y \in \mathbb{Q} \quad \forall x>0 : 0<y<x
$$

This statement just swaps the quantifying statements. This statement is now false.

## Negations
### Example
Say we have a proposition $A$.
The negation of $A$ is the exact opposite statement. when its atoms are evaluated, $A$ and its negation always disagree.

Example: 
$A=$ There exists a left-handed student in this class
$\neg A=$ All students are right-handed in this class

### Quantifiers:
There are exactly 2:
$\exists$: There exists
$\forall$: For all

### Rules for Negations
1. Change all the quantifiers for the other
2. Don't change what comes directly after a quantifier
3. Negate the predicate

#### Example:
Negate the following statement.

$$
\forall k \in \mathbb{N},\, \exists j \in\mathbb{N}: k<j
$$
Solution:
$$
\exists k \in \mathbb{N},\, \forall j \in \mathbb{N}: k\geq j
$$
## Converse and Contrapositive
We have propositions $A$ and $B$. We have the statement 
$A\Rightarrow B$                   "if $A$ is true then $B$ is true"

The converse is $B\Rightarrow A$
the contrapositive is $\neg B\Rightarrow\neg A$
The contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent to the original implication
