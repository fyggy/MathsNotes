### Definition 1.1: Convergence
A sequence ${} a_{n} {}$ converges to $a$ if, ${} \forall \varepsilon>0, \exists n_{0}\in \mathbb{N},\forall n\geq n_{0}: \varepsilon>|a_{n}-a|$ 

### Example:
Show that ${} s_{n}=(-1)^{n}n^{2} {}$ does not converge. 
We work by way of contradiction. Suppose ${} s_{n}\to{}a$ for some ${} a \in  \mathbb{R} {}$
Then ${} \forall \varepsilon>0,\, \exists n_{0}\in \mathbb{N},\, \forall n\geq n_{0}:|(-1)^{n}n^{2}-a|<\varepsilon {}$. That is, if $n\geq n_{0} {}$, ${} (-1)^{n}n^{2}\in (a-\varepsilon,\, a+\varepsilon)$. But if ${} \varepsilon=1 {}$, the interval ${} (a-1,\, a+1) {}$ contains at most one term of the sequence, as the smallest gap between 2 terms is ${} s_{1} {}$ and $s_{2}$.
So, we can't have infinitely many terms inside ${} (a-1,\, a+1) {}$, which is a contradiction.
So ${} s_{n}$ does not converge to $a$, so ${} s_{n}$ cannot converge at all.
