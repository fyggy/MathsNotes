### Boundedness
Let ${} S\subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ be a set of real numbers. 
We say that ${} S {}$ is bounded above if ${} \exists M\in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that ${} x\leq M$ for all $x \in S$
We say that $S$ is bounded below if ${} \exists m \in \mathbb{R}$ such that ${} x\geq m {}$ for all $x \in S$
We say that $S$ is bounded if it is bounded from above and below
#### Examples:
1. $S=\{ 0 \}\cup[1,\, 2)$. $S$ is bounded above by $3$, and $S$ is bounded below by $0 {}$.
The set of upper bounds is ${} S_{+}=[2,\, \infty) {}$
The set of lower bounds is $S_{-}=(-\infty,\, 0]$
The set $S$ has no maximum, as the least upper bound is not an element of the set.
The set $S$ has a minimum, equal to $0$.

2. ${} S=\{ 2^{n}\mid n \in\mathbb{Z} \}=\{ \dots,\, 2^{-2},\,  2^{-1},\, 2^{0},\, 2^{1},\, 2^{2},\,\dots \}$
Prove that $S$ is unbounded from above. 
The usual strategy for proving that $S {}$ is not bounded is proof by contradiction

Proof:
Suppose that $S$ has an upper bound, call this ${} x \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Therefore, ${} x\geq s, \forall s \in S {}$.
We can assume that ${} x>0$, as $S$ only contains positive elements.
We want to find $n \in\mathbb{Z} {}$ such that $2^{n}>x$. Now ${} 2^{n}>x \iff n>\log_{2}x {}$

Take ${} n=\ceil*{\log_{2}(x)}+1 $

3. ${} A=\left\{  (-1)^{n}\left( 1-\frac{1}{n^{2}} \right)\mid n \in\mathbb{N}  \right\} {}$
