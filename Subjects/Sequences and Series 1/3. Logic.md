# Logic Crash Course
## Propositions
### Valid statements

Here are 2 types of statements:
"There are infinitely many natural numbers $n$ such that $n$ and $n+2$ are both prime"
"There are infinitely many natural numbers $n$ such that $n$ and $n+2$ are both very interesting"

First statement is able to be rigorised, and any 2 people can agree on what it means
The second statement is subjective, and any 2 people might not necessarily agree on what it means
First statement can be either true or false
Second statement can be true today and false tomorrow

A proposition is just a word meaning "admissible assertion"
