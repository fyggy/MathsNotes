## Chapter 1: Propositions and connectives

### Definition 1.1: Propositional Symbols
A proposition is made up of 3 types of symbols:
Atoms: $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, \dots, \text{and}\,\bot$
Connectives: $\wedge, \vee, \to{}, \leftrightarrow, ¬$
Auxiliary symbols: $( \,\,\text{and} \,\,)$

Atoms are stand in for propositions or values that cannot be reduced. During valuation, they are replaced by truth values. During substitution, they are replaced by other statements. Point is, they are meaningless placeholders, designed to be replaced at a later date. The falsity $\bot$ is a special character, that is not strictly needed, but is very nice to have as a shorthand.

Connectives are the real bread and butter of a logical proposition. they take some propositions (perhaps 1), and give you a new proposition, with a truth value depending on its inputs
They mean, in order: 
* $\wedge$: and
* $\vee$: or
* $\to{}$: implication/if … then …
* $\leftrightarrow$: equivalence/if and only if
* $¬$: negation

Auxiliary symbols are only used to decide the order that the connectives should be applied.

### Definition 1.2: PROP

The set $PROP$ is the set of all logical propositions. It is defined to be the **smallest** (meaning with no subsets that fulfil the following property) set such that
* all $p_{i}$, for natural $i$ are in PROP, and $\bot$ is in PROP
* Given 2 propositions in PROP $\varphi$ and $\psi$, for any given operation $\square \in \{\wedge, \vee, \to{}, \leftrightarrow\}$, $(\varphi \square \psi$ )is in PROP
* Given a proposition in prop $\varphi$, $(¬\varphi)$ is in PROP  

### Proposition 1.3: The Induction Principle

Given a property $A(\varphi)$ that maps every proposition from PROP to the value true or false, then if
* $A$ is true for all atoms $p_{i}$, and $\bot$
* for 2 props $\varphi, \psi$, $A$ is true, then $A(\varphi \square \psi)$ is true
* for a prop $\varphi$, $A$ is true, then $A(\neg \varphi)$ is true
Then $A$ is true for all props in PROP

### Definition 1.4: Formation Sequences
A formation sequence of a prop $\varphi$ is a collection of terms $(\varphi_{i})_{0\leq i\leq n}$ such that $\varphi_{n}=\varphi$, and either: 
* $\varphi_{i}$ is atomic
* $\varphi_{i}=(\varphi_{j} \square \varphi_{k})$, for some $j, k < i$
* $\varphi_{i}=(\neg \varphi_{j})$, for some $j<i$
A formation sequence may contain junk which isn't needed, and a minimal formation sequence (one with the minimal amount of elements) may be in many orders

formation sequences (form seqs for short) formalise the idea of building a proposition from scratch by starting with atoms and then connecting them using, well, connectives

### Definition from recursion
Given a set $A$, and there are three mappings, $H_{\square}:A^{2} \to{} A$, $H_{\neg}: A \to{} A$, and $H_\text{at}$, there is a unique mapping $F: PROP \to{} A$ with the properties:
* $F(\varphi) = H_\text{at}(\varphi)$, for $\varphi$ atomic
* $F((\varphi \square \psi)) = H_{\square}(F(\varphi), F(\psi))$
* $F((\neg \varphi)) = H_{\neg}(F(\varphi))$

This works by moving F up and up by using the mappings $H_{\square}$ and $H_{\neg}$, building similarly to a formation sequence.

### Definition 1.5: Trees
A Tree has leaves made of atoms, and nodes made of connectives. For example:
![[Propositional Logic 2023-09-17 10.42.48.excalidraw|200]]
Denotes the prop
$$
(p_{1} \to{} (p_{2} \wedge (p_{7} \leftrightarrow p_{2})))
$$

### Definition 1.6: Rank
The rank of a proposition is the height of its tree; the deepest nested expression. formally, it is defined for an prop $\varphi$, the rank $r(\varphi)$ is given by [[#Definition from recursion|recursion]]
* $r(\varphi)=0$ if $\varphi$ is atomic
* $r((\varphi \square \psi))=\max (r(\varphi), r(\psi)) + 1$
* $r((\neg\varphi))=r(\varphi)+1$

we observe how this increases the rank the the deeper it recurses

### Definition 1.7: Subformulae
A subformula, simply put, is a part of a formula. it contains every contiguous collection of symbols within a prop. Formally, it is a set $Sub(\varphi)$ given by
$$
\begin{align}
Sub(\varphi)&={\varphi}\quad \text{for atomic } \varphi \\
Sub(\varphi_{1}\square\varphi_{2}) & =Sub(\varphi_{1})\cup Sub(\varphi_{2})\cup\{\varphi_{1} \square \varphi_{2}  \} \\
Sub(\neg\varphi) & =Sub(\varphi)\cup\{\neg\varphi\}
\end{align}
$$
and we say that $\psi$ is a subformula of $\varphi$ iff $\psi \in Sub(\varphi)$

### Theorem 1.8: Rank-Induction Principle
If, for all $\varphi$, $(A(\psi)$ holds for all $\psi$ with rank less than $r(\varphi))$ implies that $A(\varphi)$ holds, then $A(\varphi)$ holds for all $\varphi \in PROP$

First lets introduce some notation to talk about rank. write $\varphi \prec \psi$ iff $r(\varphi)<r(\psi)$
Condensed down, the Rank-Induction Principle now says $$
\forall \varphi:((\forall \psi \prec \varphi :A(\psi))\Rightarrow A(\varphi))\Rightarrow\forall \varphi:A(\varphi)
$$
This theorem says that this follows for the [[1. Propositional Logic#Proposition 1.3 The Induction Principle|induction principle]] and vice versa.
#### Proof of 1.8
Suppose that 
$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
\forall \varphi:((\forall \psi \prec \varphi :A(\psi))\Rightarrow A(\varphi))
\end{equation}
$$
Is given. We intend to deduce that this implies $\forall\varphi:A(\varphi)$. define $B$ to the statement $B(\varphi):= \forall\psi \preceq \varphi: A(\psi)$. Note that this is almost the statement inside of the brackets. We now show that $\forall\varphi:B(\varphi)$ by induction on $\varphi$

1. If $\varphi$ is atomic, then we have that $\forall \psi \prec \varphi: A(\psi)$ is vacuously true. Therefore, by $(1)$, $A(\varphi)$ is true. Thus we have that $A(\psi)$ holds for all $\psi$ with $r(\psi)\leq 0$. So $B(\psi)$ is true.
2. If $\varphi=\varphi_{1}\square \varphi_{2}$, then we can have the induction hypothesis that $B(\varphi_{1}), B(\varphi_{2})$ are both true. let $\rho$ be a proposition with $r(\rho)=r(\varphi)=n+1$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$. We want to show that $\rho$, along with all propositions with rank less than $n+1$ hold the property $A$. Since we have $r(\varphi)=\max(r(\varphi_{1}), r(\varphi_{2}))+1$, at least one of either $\varphi_{1}$ or $\varphi_{2}$ must have rank $n$. WLOG, lets say its $\varphi_{1}$. By $B(\varphi_{1})$, we have $\forall\psi\preceq\varphi_{1}:A(\psi)$ This shows that we have $\forall\psi\prec\rho:A(\psi)$, as $\varphi_{1}\prec\rho$ By $(1)$, we now have that $A(\rho)$ holds. This shows that $B(\varphi)$ holds too.
3. $\varphi=\neg\varphi_{1}$. Almost identical argument as above

If we apply the induction principle using the above argument, then we get $\forall\varphi:B(\varphi)$. Since $B(\varphi)\Rightarrow A(\varphi)$, we have $\forall\varphi: A(\varphi)$

Conversely, if we assume the premises of the induction principle, we can show the rank-induction principle. To do so, we must show the truth of $(1)$. Pick an arbitrary $\varphi$
1. $\varphi$ is atomic. Then, $(1)$ holds vacuously
2. $\varphi=\varphi_{1}\square\varphi_{2}$. Then we have $\varphi_{1},\,\varphi_{2}\prec\varphi$

Honestly I don't understand this and the book says I don't have to. Ill come back to this
