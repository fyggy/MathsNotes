First, we define Lie Groups. A *smooth manifold* is essentially a shape in space with a topology, and appears *locally smooth*, with smooth here being analogous to a function being infinitely differentiable. A Lie group is a smooth manifold with group structure, such that group multiplication and inversion are also smooth maps. The prototypical example is ${} \mathrm{SO}(2) {}$, the group of rotations in $2$-D. It can be represented as a circle, and it is clear to see that the group operation is smooth. 

A Lie *algebra* is an algebra defined tangent to the identity of a Lie Group. The formal construction is fairly nuanced, however, it can be shown that a connected Lie group is generated by any open neighbourhood of the identity
