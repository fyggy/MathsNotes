Let ${} V= \bigcup _{1}^{n}V_{i} {}$. Clearly ${} x_{0} \in V {}$, and suppose that ${} x_{0} \in \Fr(V) {}$. Then the ${} \{ A_{\lambda} \}-\{ A_{\lambda_{i}} \}_{i=1}^{n} {}$ cover $\mathscr{C}V {}$, and do not contain $x_{0}$. Let ${} A=\bigcup_{\lambda\neq \lambda_{i}} A_{\lambda} {}$, and since the $A_{\lambda} {}$ are nbd-finite, then ${} A$ is closed. Now since ${} x_{0} \in \Fr(V) {}$, then ${} x_{0} \in \conj{A} \supseteq \conj{\mathscr{C}V} {}$, but ${} x_{0}\notin A {}$. Therefore, $A$ is not closed, which is a contradiction, and so ${} x_{0} \notin \Fr(V) {}$, so ${} x_{0} \in \Int(V) {}$, so there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ with ${} U \subseteq  V {}$.

Let ${} x \in X {}$. Suppose that for all neighbourhoods $V$ of $x$, ${} V \cap A_{n}\neq \varnothing  {}$ for infinitely many ${} A_{n}$. Then if $\mathscr{N}$ is the set of all neighbourhoods of $x$, then let 
$$
N_{k}=A_{k} \cap  \bigcap_{N\in \mathscr{N}} N
$$
Now ${} x \in  {}$

Let ${} x \in X {}$. Then there must exist some ${} n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$ such that for ${} k\geq n {}$,  ${} x \notin \conj{A_{k}} {}$. Now suppose that for every neighbourhood ${} V$ of $x$, then ${} V \cap  A_{i}\neq \varnothing  {}$ for infinitely many ${} A_{i} {}$. Then since ${} x \in A_{i} {}$ implies that ${} x \in A_{j} {}$, if ${} j\geq i {}$, then that implies that ${} V \cap  A_{i}\neq \varnothing  {}$ for all ${} i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, and therefore ${} x \in \conj{A_{i}} {}$. This is a contradiction, as therefore ${} x \in \varnothing =\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \conj{A_{n}} {}$, and so ${} \{ A_{i} \} {}$ is a nbd-finite family.

a)
Let ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ be open. Then ${} A=\bigcup_{B\in \mathscr{B}}B  {}$, where $B$ are open intervals, as this is a basis for the topology on $\mathbb{R} {}$. In particular, suppose that $\mathscr{B} {}$ is the set of all open intervals contained in $A {}$. Now for all ${} x \in A {}$, let ${} \mathscr{B}(x)$ be the set of elements of $\mathscr{B} {}$ containing $x$, and let ${} A(x)=\bigcup \mathscr{B}(x) {}$. Then each ${} A(x)$ must be an interval, as if ${} b(x)=\sup _{B \in \mathscr{B}(x)}\left( \sup B \right) {}$ and ${} a(x)=\inf _{B \in \mathscr{B}(x)}\left( \inf B \right) {}$, then ${} A(x)$ must contain all ${} y \in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that ${} b(x)>y>a(x) {}$. 

Now let ${} y \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Then suppose that ${} A(y) \cap  A(x) \neq \varnothing  {}$. Then ${} a(x)>b(y) {}$, and ${} A(y) \cup A(x) {}$ is an open interval containing both $x$ and $y$. Therefore, ${} A(x)=A(y) {}$. Now 
$$
S=\{ A(x) \mid x \in A \}
$$
is a set of disjoint open intervals with ${} \bigcup S=A {}$.
