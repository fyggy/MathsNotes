1. 
Let ${} V= \bigcup _{1}^{n}V_{i} {}$. Clearly ${} x_{0} \in V {}$, and suppose that ${} x_{0} \in \Fr(V) {}$. Then the ${} \{ A_{\lambda} \}-\{ A_{\lambda_{i}} \}_{i=1}^{n} {}$ cover $\mathscr{C}V {}$, and do not contain $x_{0}$. Let ${} A=\bigcup_{\lambda\neq \lambda_{i}} A_{\lambda} {}$, and since the $A_{\lambda} {}$ are nbd-finite, then ${} A$ is closed. Now since ${} x_{0} \in \Fr(V) {}$, then ${} x_{0} \in \conj{A} \supseteq \conj{\mathscr{C}V} {}$, but ${} x_{0}\notin A {}$. Therefore, $A$ is not closed, which is a contradiction, and so ${} x_{0} \notin \Fr(V) {}$, so ${} x_{0} \in \Int(V) {}$, so there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $x$ with ${} U \subseteq  V {}$.
2. 
Let ${} x \in X {}$. Suppose that for all neighbourhoods $V$ of $x$, ${} V \cap A_{n}\neq \varnothing  {}$ for infinitely many ${} A_{n}$. Then if $\mathscr{N}$ is the set of all neighbourhoods of $x$, then let 
$$
N_{k}=A_{k} \cap  \bigcap_{N\in \mathscr{N}} N
$$
Now ${} x \in  {}$

Let ${} x \in X {}$. Then there must exist some ${} n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$ such that for ${} k\geq n {}$,  ${} x \notin \conj{A_{k}} {}$. Now suppose that for every neighbourhood $V$ of $x$, then ${} V \cap  A_{i}\neq \varnothing  {}$ for infinitely many ${} A_{i} {}$
