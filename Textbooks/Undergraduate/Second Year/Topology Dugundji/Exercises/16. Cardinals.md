1. 
Let ${} A {}$ be a finite set totally ordered under $\prec {}$. Let ${} S \subseteq A {}$. Now suppose that $S$ has no first element. Then, for all ${} s \in S {}$, there exists some ${} s\neq t \in S {}$ with ${} t \prec s {}$. This forms an infinite decreasing sequence of unique elements, which clearly cannot exist as ${} A {}$ is finite. 

Now let $A {}$ be an infinite set. Then well order $A$ by $\prec$, and totally order $A$ by $<$, where $a<b {}$ iff ${} b \prec a {}$. Now since $A$ is infinite, then it contains a well ordered set isomorphic to $\omega$ under ${} \prec {}$. Then under $<$, it contains a set isomorphic to $\omega^{*}$, and as proved before, this shows that $<$ is not a well order.
2. 
Let $A$ be the set of all countable subsets of ${} E^{1}$. Then clearly ${} E^{1}\to{f}A {}$ defined by ${} x \mapsto \{ x \} {}$ is an injection. Now define ${} A \to{g}E^{1} {}$ by, given ${} S \in A {}$, order $S$ by the natural order in ${} E^{1}$.
