1. 
Let ${} A {}$ be a finite set totally ordered under $\prec {}$. Let ${} S \subseteq A {}$. Now suppose that $S$ has no first element. Then, for all ${} s \in S {}$, there exists some ${} s\neq t \in S {}$ with ${} t \prec s {}$. This forms an infinite decreasing sequence of unique elements, which clearly cannot exist as ${} A {}$ is finite. 

Now let $A {}$ be an infinite set. Then well order $A$ by $\prec$, and totally order $A$ by $<$, where $a<b {}$ iff ${} b \prec a {}$. Now since $A$ is infinite, then it contains a well ordered set isomorphic to $\omega$ under ${} \prec {}$. Then under $<$, it contains a set isomorphic to $\omega^{*}$, and as proved before, this shows that $<$ is not a well order.

Let $A$ be the set of all countable subsets of ${} E^{1}$. Then clearly ${} E^{1}\to{f}A {}$ defined by ${} x \mapsto \{ x \} {}$ is an injection. 

Now let ${} S \in A {}$, and let $\prec$ be a well ordering of ${} E^{1}$. Then $S$ is well ordered, and since it is countable then there exists an isomorphism $m:\omega\to{}S {}$. Now for each ${} s \in S {}$, we have a unique decimal expansion:
$$
s=\sum_{n=-k}^{\infty} a_{n} 10^{-n}
$$
where we do not take ${} a_{i}=a_{i+k}=9 {}$ for some ${} i\geq -k {}$ and for all ${} k \in \mathbb{N} {}$.
