If all closed sets are ${} G_{\delta} {}$, then if ${} F {}$ is ${} F_{\sigma} {}$, then we have a sequence of closed sets ${} \{ F_{i} \}_{i=1}^{\infty}  {}$ such that
$$
F = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty }F_{1} 
$$
Then each ${} F_{i}$ is $G_{\delta}$, and since they are closed, they are the union of a single closed set and therefore $F_{\sigma}$, and bivalent. Therefore, ${} H_{n}=F_{n}-\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}F_{i}  {}$ is a sequence of disjoint bivalent sets such that 
$$
F=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} H_{i}
$$
