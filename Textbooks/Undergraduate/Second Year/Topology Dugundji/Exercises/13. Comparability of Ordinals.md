Let ${} \mathscr{F}=\{ I \in I(W) \mid  \exists f:I\to{}J\text{ an isomorphism with }J \in I(X)\} {}$, and order $\mathscr{F}$ by inclusion. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be a chain in $\mathscr{F}$, and let ${} U=\bigcup \mathscr{A} {}$. Let ${} A \in \mathscr{F} {}$ with ${} f:A\to{}I {}$ and $g:A\to{}J {}$ isomorphisms with ${} I,\, J \in I(X) {}$. Then there exists an isomorphism ${} g\circ f^{-1}:I\to{}J {}$, and ${} I=J {}$. Therefore, for each ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$, there exists some unique ${} B \in I(X) {}$ with $f:A\to{}B {}$ an isomorphism. Let $\mathscr{B}$ be the set of all such ideals, and let ${} V=\bigcup \mathscr{B} \in I(X) {}$.

We now define $f:U\to{}V {}$ by, if ${} x \in U {}$, then ${} x \in A {}$ for some ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$. Then there exists some isomorphism ${} f_{A}: A\to{}B {}$ for some unique ${} B \in \mathscr{B} {}$. Define ${} f(x)=f_{A}(x) {}$. We show that this is well defined: Suppose that ${} x \in A' \supseteq A {}$. Then ${} f_{A'}: A' \to{}B' {}$, and by 4.1 there is at most 1 isomorphism between ${} A \subseteq A' {}$ and ${} B \subseteq B' {}$. Since we already have one, then ${} f_{A'}(x)=f_{A}(x) {}$, and $f$ is well defined. Therefore, ${} U \in \mathscr{F} {}$ is an upper bound for $\mathscr{A}$, and $\mathscr{F}$ has a maximal element $M$ with ${} F:M \to{} N {}$, for some ideal ${} N \subseteq X {}$. 

Now suppose that $M \neq W {}$. Now suppose that $N\neq X$. Then there exists some ${} n \in X {}$ with ${} N=X(n) {}$, and some ${} m \in W {}$ with ${} M=W(m) {}$. Now the isomorphism ${} F':M \cup \{m\}\to{}N \cup \{n\} {}$ defined by 
$$
F'(x)=\begin{cases}
n, & \text{ if }x=m \\
F(X),  & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
Shows that $M$ is not maximal, therefore, ${} N =X {}$, and case ${} (3) {}$ holds with $X$, ${} M=W(m) {}$ and ${} F^{-1} {}$.

Now suppose that $M =W {}$. Then if $N\neq X$, again we have ${} n \in X {}$ with ${} N =X(n) {}$, and we have case ${} (2)$. Otherwise, we have case ${} (1) {}$.

No, consider $A=\omega$ and ${} B=\{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$. Then ${} B \times  A \cong A {}$, which is isomorphic to the ideal ${} \{ (n,\, 0) \mid  n \in A \} {}$.
