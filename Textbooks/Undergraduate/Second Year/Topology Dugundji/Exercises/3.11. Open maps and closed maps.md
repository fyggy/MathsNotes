a)
Consider the set of open squares on ${} \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ as a basis for the topology on $\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$. Now if ${} S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ is an open square, then ${} S=\{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid a_{1}<x<b_{1},\, a_{2}<y<b_{2}\}  {}$, and ${} p(S)=(a_{1},\, b_{1}) {}$ is open, therefore, $p$ is open
b)
Clearly ${} S={} \{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid xy=1\} {}$ is closed, as it is a boundary set. Suppose that ${} (0, a) \in S {}$. Then ${} a\cdot 0=1 {}$, which is a contradiction, so ${} 0 \notin p(S) {}$. However, given ${} 0\neq x \in \mathbb{R} {}$, we have ${} \left( x,\, \frac{1}{x} \right) \in S {}$, and so ${} p(S)=\mathbb{R}-\{ 0 \} {}$, and since ${} \{ 0 \} {}$ is closed, then $p(S)$ is open. Therefore, $p {}$ is not closed. 
2. 
Let ${} f,\, g:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ be closed functions. Then let ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$. Now suppose that ${} x \in \conj{(f\cdot g)(A)} {}$. Then, if $U$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then ${} U \cap  (f\cdot g)(A)\neq \varnothing  {}$

First, note that $f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ defined by $x\mapsto a$, where $a$ is constant, is closed, as ${} f(A)=\{ a \} {}$ for any closed set, and ${} \{ a \} {}$ is closed. Now suppose that $f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is a polynomial and is closed. Then let ${} g(x)=f(x)\cdot x {}$. Now if $S$ is closed, 
3. 
Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ be continuous and bijective. Now if ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is an open interval, then ${} A=(a,\, b) {}$. We have 2 cases:
1) ${} f(a)<f(b) {}$. Then suppose that ${} f(A)\neq (f(a),\, f(b)) {}$. Now there exists some ${} x \in (f(a),\, f(b)) {}$ such that ${} f^{-1}(x)\notin A {}$. Now the inverse image
