a)
Consider the set of open squares on ${} \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ as a basis for the topology on $\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$. Now if ${} S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ is an open square, then ${} S=\{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid a_{1}<x<b_{1},\, a_{2}<y<b_{2}\}  {}$, and ${} p(S)=(a_{1},\, b_{1}) {}$ is open, therefore, $p$ is open
b)
Clearly ${} S={} \{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid xy=1\} {}$ is closed, as it is a boundary set. Suppose that ${} (0, a) \in S {}$. Then ${} a\cdot 0=1 {}$, which is a contradiction, so ${} 0 \notin p(S) {}$. However, given ${} 0\neq x \in \mathbb{R} {}$, we have ${} \left( x,\, \frac{1}{x} \right) \in S {}$, and so ${} p(S)=\mathbb{R}-\{ 0 \} {}$, and since ${} \{ 0 \} {}$ is closed, then $p(S)$ is open. Therefore, $p {}$ is not closed.
