1. 
a)
Consider the set of open squares on ${} \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ as a basis for the topology on $\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$. Now if ${} S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ is an open square, then ${} S=\{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid a_{1}<x<b_{1},\, a_{2}<y<b_{2}\}  {}$, and ${} p(S)=(a_{1},\, b_{1}) {}$ is open, therefore, $p$ is open
b)
Clearly ${} S={} \{ (x,\, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid xy=1\} {}$ is closed, as it is a boundary set. Suppose that ${} (0, a) \in S {}$. Then ${} a\cdot 0=1 {}$, which is a contradiction, so ${} 0 \notin p(S) {}$. However, given ${} 0\neq x \in \mathbb{R} {}$, we have ${} \left( x,\, \frac{1}{x} \right) \in S {}$, and so ${} p(S)=\mathbb{R}-\{ 0 \} {}$, and since ${} \{ 0 \} {}$ is closed, then $p(S)$ is open. Therefore, $p {}$ is not closed.

Clearly, ${} |f(a)|\leq \sup \{ |f(x)| \mid  x \in A \}=M {}$. Now let ${} a \in \Int(A) {}$. Then there exists some open ball ${} f(a) \in B(f(a);\epsilon) \subseteq f(A) {}$. Therefore, ${} |f(a)|+\epsilon\leq M {}$, and so ${} |f(a)|<M {}$.

Let $f:X\to{}Y {}$ be open. Then
$$
\begin{align}
 f^{-1}(\Fr(B)) & =  f^{-1}(\conj{B} \cap  \conj{\mathscr{C}B}) \\
 & =f^{-1}(\conj{B}) \cap  f^{-1}(\conj{\mathscr{C}B})
 \end{align}
$$
Let ${} B \subseteq Y {}$. Then if ${} x \in f^{-1}(\Fr(B)) {}$ and if ${} U$ is an neighbourhood of $x$, then ${} V=f(U) {}$ is an neighbourhood of ${} f(x)$. Then ${} V \cap  B \neq \varnothing {}$, and ${} V \cap  \mathscr{C}B\neq \varnothing  {}$ and therefore, ${} f^{-1}(V \cap  B) \neq \varnothing \neq f^{-1}(V \cap  \mathscr{C}B) {}$. Now ${} W=f^{-1}(f(U)) {}$, and ${} U \subseteq W {}$. 

Suppose that ${} f^{-1}(\conj{B}) \subseteq \conj{f^{-1}(B)} {}$. Then let ${} A \subseteq X {}$, and so ${} B=f(f^{-1}(A)) {}$

Suppose that ${} f^{-1}(\Fr(B)) \subseteq \Fr(f^{-1}(B)) {}$. Now let ${} A \subseteq X {}$ be open. Then let ${} B=f(A) {}$, and so ${} A \subseteq f^{-1}(B)=f^{-1}(\Fr(B)) \cup f^{-1}(\Int(B)) \subseteq \Fr(f^{-1}(B)) \cup  f^{-1}(\Int(B)) {}$
