a)
$$
\begin{align}
\conj{Q} & =E^{1} \\
Q' & =E^{1} \\
\Int(Q) & =\mathscr{C}\conj{\mathscr{C}Q}=\mathscr{C}E^{1}=\varnothing   \\
\Fr(Q) & =\conj{Q} \cap  \conj{\mathscr{C}Q}=E^{1} \cap E^{1}=E^{1}

$$
b)
Suppose that ${} x \notin C {}$. Then the trinary expansion of $x {}$ has some first $1$. Let ${} y \in E^{1} {}$
