1. 
We have that ${} \{ 1 \} {}$ is open in $2$, but ${} f^{-1}(\{ 1 \})=\{ 1 \} {}$ is not open in $\mathscr{S} {}$, and so $f {}$ is not continuous
2. 
Let ${} a \in [0,\, 1) {}$, and let ${} W {}$ be a neighbourhood of ${} c(a)=1 {}$. That is, ${} W=\{ 1 \} {}$ or ${} W=\{ 0,\, 1 \}. {}$ If $W=\{ 1 \} {}$, then ${} V=[0,\, 1) =(-1,\, 1) \cap [0,\, 1] {}$ is an open neighbourhood in ${} [0,\, 1] {}$ of ${} a {}$ such that ${} c(V)=\{ 1 \} \subseteq W {}$. Otherwise, if ${} W=\{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$, then let $V {}$ be any subset of ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. then ${} c(V) \subseteq W {}$. Therefore, $c {}$ is continuous at ${} a \in [0,\, 1) {}$.

Now if ${} W {}$ is an neighbourhood of ${} c(1)=0 {}$, then ${} W=\{ 0 \} {}$ or ${} W=\{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$. If ${} W=\{ 0 \} {}$, then suppose that given an open ${} A\subseteq [0,\, 1] {}$, then ${} c(A)=\{ 0 \} {}$. Then ${} A \cap [0,\, 1)=\varnothing  {}$, and so ${} A \subseteq \{ 1 \} {}$. Then ${} A=\varnothing  {}$, and so ${} c(A)=\varnothing  {}$, or ${} A=\{ 1 \} {}$, which is closed in ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. Therefore, $c$ is not continuous at $1$. 
3. 
Suppose that ${} A \subseteq X {}$ is clopen. Let ${} V \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ be an open set such. Now if ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\varnothing  {}$, then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V) =\varnothing  {}$ is open. If ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\{ 0 \}  {}$, then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V)=\mathscr{C}A {}$ is open, since $A$ is closed. If ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\{ 1 \} {}$, then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V)=A {}$ is open, since $A$ is open. Finally, if ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\{ 0,\, 1 \} {}$, then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V)=X {}$ is open. Therefore $c_{A}$ is continuous

Conversely, suppose that $c_{A}$ is continuous. Then let ${} V \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ be open such that ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\{ 0 \} {}$. Then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V)=\mathscr{C}A {}$. Then since $V$ is open, then $\mathscr{C}A$ is open and $A$ is closed. Furthermore, if ${} V \cap  \{ 0,\, 1 \}=\{ 1 \} {}$, then ${} c_{A}^{-1}(V)=A {}$, and since $V$ is again open, then $A$ is open, and so $A$ is clopen.

5. We must have that neither ${} \mathcal{T}_{1} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{2} {}$ or ${} \mathcal{T}_{2} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{1} {}$. 
6. 
Let $f:X\to{}X {}$. Suppose $f {}$ is continuous. Then if ${} x \in X {}$, then ${} \mathscr{C}\{ x \} {}$ is open, and so ${} \mathscr{C}f^{-1}(\mathscr{C}\{ x \}) {}$ is finite. Now
$$
\begin{align}
 \mathscr{C} f^{-1}(X-\{ x \})   & =\mathscr{C}(f^{-1}(X)-f^{-1}(\{ x \})) \\
 & =\mathscr{C}(f^{-1}(X) \cap  \mathscr{C}f^{-1}(\{ x \})) \\
 & =\mathscr{C}f^{-1}(X) \cup f^{-1}(\{ x \})
 \end{align}
$$
since ${} \mathscr{C}f^{-1}(X) {}$ is finite, then ${} f^{-1}(\{ x \}) {}$ must be finite.

Conversely, suppose that for all ${} x \in X {}$, then ${} f^{-1}(\{ x \}) {}$ is finite. Then let ${} W \subseteq X {}$ be open. Now since $\mathscr{C}W {}$ is finite, then
$$
f^{-1}(\mathscr{C}W)=\bigcup_{w\in \mathscr{C}W} f^{-1}(\{ w \})
$$
is a finite union of finite sets, and therefore finite. Therefore, 
$$
f^{-1}(\mathscr{C}W)=f^{-1}(X) \cap  \mathscr{C}f^{-1}(W)
$$
and since $X$ is infinite, then ${} f^{-1}(X)=X {}$ is infinite, and so ${} \mathscr{C}f^{-1}(W) {}$ must be finite. therefore, $f {}$ is continuous. 

Therefore, ${} f$ is continuous iff ${} f^{-1}(\{ x \}) {}$ is finite for all ${} x \in X {}$
7. 
Let $f:X\to{}X {}$ be order preserving. Let ${} V \subseteq X {}$ be open. Then let ${} x \in f^{-1}(V) {}$, and let ${} y \prec x {}$. Then ${} f(y)\prec f(x) {}$, and so ${} f(y) \in V {}$ as ${} f(x) \in V {}$. Therefore, ${} y \in f^{-1}(V) {}$.

Conversely, let $f {}$ be continuous. Then let ${} x,\, y \in X {}$ with $y\prec x$, then if $V$ is a neighbourhood containing ${} f(x) {}$, then there must exist a neighbourhood ${} W {}$ of ${} x$ such that ${} f(W) \subseteq V {}$. Then ${} y \in W {}$, and so ${} f(y) \in V {}$. Suppose that ${} f(y) \not \prec  f(x) {}$. Then there exists a neighbourhood of ${} f(x)$ that does not contain ${} f(y)$, by taking an neighbourhood of ${} f(x)$ and removing all elements ${} m\succ f(y)$. However, this is a contradiction, as every neighbourhood of ${} f(x)$ contains ${} f(y)$. Therefore, ${} f(y)\prec f(x) {}$, and $f$ is order preserving

(${} a\Rightarrow b {}$). Let ${} A \subseteq X {}$, and let ${} x \in f(A') {}$. Then ${} x=f(y) {}$, and if $V$ is an neighbourhood of $y$, then ${} V-\{ y \} \cap  A\neq \varnothing  {}$. Now let $W$ be an neighbourhood of $f()$
