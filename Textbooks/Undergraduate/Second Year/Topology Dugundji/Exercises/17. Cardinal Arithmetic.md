Let $A$ be a set with ${} \aleph(A)=\bar{\aleph} {}$. Then, given a cardinal ${} \aleph <\bar{\aleph} {}$, there exists a subset ${} B \subseteq A {}$ with $\aleph(B)=\aleph {}$, and so ${} \aleph(A-B)=\bar{\aleph} {}$, and ${} \aleph(A-(A-B))=\bar{\aleph}-\bar{\aleph}=\aleph {}$, and so ${} \bar{\aleph}-\bar{\aleph} {}$ is indeterminant.

Simply set ${} A_{\alpha}=E {}$.

Suppose that ${} \aleph_{1}=2^{\aleph_{0}} {}$. Then ${} \aleph_{2} \leq \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}}\leq 2^{\aleph_{2}} {}$, and $\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}}=\aleph_{1} {}$. Since ${} \aleph_{2} > \aleph_{1} {}$, then
$$
\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}} < \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}}
$$
Conversely, suppose that $\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}} < \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}} {}$. Then I did this later
