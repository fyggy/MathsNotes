Let $A$ be a set with ${} \aleph(A)=\bar{\aleph} {}$. Then, given a cardinal ${} \aleph <\bar{\aleph} {}$, there exists a subset ${} B \subseteq A {}$ with $\aleph(B)=\aleph {}$, and so ${} \aleph(A-B)=\bar{\aleph} {}$, and ${} \aleph(A-(A-B))=\bar{\aleph}-\bar{\aleph}=\aleph {}$, and so ${} \bar{\aleph}-\bar{\aleph} {}$ is indeterminant.

Simply set ${} A_{\alpha}=E {}$.

Suppose that ${} \aleph_{1}=2^{\aleph_{0}} {}$. Then ${} \aleph_{2} \leq \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}}\leq 2^{\aleph_{2}} {}$, and $\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}}=\aleph_{1} {}$. Since ${} \aleph_{2} > \aleph_{1} {}$, then
$$
\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}} < \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}}
$$
Conversely, suppose that $\aleph_{1}^{\aleph_{0}} < \aleph_{2}^{\aleph_{0}} {}$. Then I did this later
8. 
Set ${} \aleph=\aleph(A) {}$. Well order ${} A$ by $\prec$. Then there exists some ordinal ${} \underline{\alpha} \in \mathscr{L} {}$ isomorphic to $A$. Let this isomorphism be ${} a:\underline{\alpha}\to{}A {}$, denoted by ${} a_{\underline{\beta}} {}$. 

Now let $f:A\to{}A {}$ be an injection. Then ${} f(a_{\underline{0}}) {}$ has $\aleph$ possibilities, and ${} f(a_{\underline{\beta}}) {}$ has ${} \aleph-\aleph(\underline{\beta}) {}$ possibilities. Therefore, the number of injections from $A\to{}A {}$ is
$$
I=\prod _{\underline{\beta} \in  \underline{\alpha}}\aleph-\aleph(\underline{\beta})
$$
Now if ${} \aleph$ is finite, then ${} I=\aleph! {}$. However, if $\aleph$ is transfinite, then if ${} \aleph-\aleph(\underline{\beta})=\underline{\aleph} {}$
