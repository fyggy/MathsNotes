Let ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$. Then if $A$ has an upper bound, then ${} \sup A \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Now let $V$ be a neighbourhood of $\sup A {}$. Then $V {}$ contains an open interval ${} U \subseteq V {}$ such that ${} \sup A \in U {}$. Then if ${} U \cap A=\varnothing  {}$, then there exists an element ${} y \in U {}$ with ${} y<\sup A {}$ and $y>a {}$ for all ${} a \in A {}$, which is a contradiction as then ${} y=\sup A>\sup A {}$. Therefore, ${} V\cap A {}$ is non-empty, and ${} \sup A \in \conj{A} {}$. 

Now if $A$ doesn't have an upper bound, then ${} \sup A=\infty  {}$. Then if $V {}$ is a neighbourhood of ${} \infty  {}$, then $V {}$ must contain an open interval ${} U=\left( x,\, \infty  \right] {}$. Then if ${} U \cap  A=\varnothing  {}$, then there exists some ${} b \in U {}$ such that ${} b <\infty  {}$ and $b>a {}$ for all ${} a \in A {}$, and ${} \infty >b=\infty  {}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ${} U \cap A {}$ is non-empty and ${} \infty =\sup A \in \conj{A} {}$.

Suppose that ${} \{ x \} {}$ is open, with ${} x \in \mathbb{Q} {}$. Then ${} A=\mathbb{Q} - \{ x \} {}$ is closed, and ${} \conj{A}=A {}$. Now if ${} V$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then ${} V=\mathbb{Q} \cap  V' {}$ for some ${} V' {}$ open in $\mathbb{R}$. Then $V' {}$ contains some open interval ${} U' {}$ containing ${} x$, and ${} U=\mathbb{Q} \cap U' {}$. Now since $A$ is closed in ${} \mathbb{Q} {}$, then ${} U' {}$ must contain only irrational points, except for $x$. However, if ${} a,\, b \in U' {}$ are irrational, then there must exist some ${} y \in U' {}$ with ${} a<y<b {}$, and ${} y {}$ rational. Therefore, ${} U \cap A\neq \varnothing  {}$, and ${} x \in \conj{A}\neq A {}$. Therefore, ${} \{ x \} {}$ is not open, and ${} \mathbb{Q} {}$ is not discrete.

First, let ${} x,\, y \in K {}$ and ${} n,\, m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Then if ${} z \in B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right) {}$, then ${} d(x,\, z)<\frac{1}{n} {}$ and ${} d(y,\, z)<\frac{1}{m} {}$. Now let ${} \ell=\max(m,\, n) {}$. Then if ${} d(a,\, z)<\frac{1}{\ell} {}$, then $a$ and $z$ agree on their first $\ell$ digits, and so $a$ and $x$ agree on their first $n$ digits and ${} a {}$ and $y {}$ agree on their first $m {}$ digits. Therefore, ${} a \in B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right)  {}$, and so
$$
B\left( z; \frac{1}{\max(n,\, m)} \right) \subseteq  B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right) {}
$$
Therefore the balls form a basis for a topology ${} \mathcal{T}' {}$. Let the induced topology be $\mathcal{T} {}$, and let
$$
\mathscr{B}=\{ B(x;1/n) \mid  x \in K,\, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \}
$$

Now let ${} B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right) \in \mathscr{B} {}$, and ${} y \in B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right) {}$. Now let ${} d=|x-y|<\frac{1}{n} {}$. Take ${} U'=\{ r \in \mathbb{R}\mid |y- r|<d \} {}$, and $U$
