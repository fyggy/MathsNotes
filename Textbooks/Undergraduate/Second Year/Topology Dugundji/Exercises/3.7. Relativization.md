Let ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$. Then if $A$ has an upper bound, then ${} \sup A \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Now let $V$ be a neighbourhood of $\sup A {}$. Then $V {}$ contains an open interval ${} U \subseteq V {}$ such that ${} \sup A \in U {}$. Then if ${} U \cap A=\varnothing  {}$, then there exists an element ${} y \in U {}$ with ${} y<\sup A {}$ and $y>a {}$ for all ${} a \in A {}$, which is a contradiction as then ${} y=\sup A>\sup A {}$. Therefore, ${} V\cap A {}$ is non-empty, and ${} \sup A \in \conj{A} {}$. 

Now if $A$ doesn't have an upper bound, then ${} \sup A=\infty  {}$. Then if $V {}$ is a neighbourhood of ${} \infty  {}$, then $V {}$ must contain an open interval ${} U=\left( x,\, \infty  \right] {}$. Then if ${} U \cap  A=\varnothing  {}$, then there exists some ${} b \in U {}$ such that ${} b <\infty  {}$ and $b>a {}$ for all ${} a \in A {}$, and ${} \infty >b=\infty  {}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ${} U \cap A {}$ is non-empty and ${} \infty =\sup A \in \conj{A} {}$.

Suppose that ${} \{ x \} {}$ is open, with ${} x \in \mathbb{Q} {}$. Then ${} A=\mathbb{Q} - \{ x \} {}$ is closed, and ${} \conj{A}=A {}$. Now if ${} V$ is a neighbourhood of $x$, then ${} V=\mathbb{Q} \cap  V' {}$ for some ${} V' {}$ open in $\mathbb{R}$. Then $V' {}$ contains some open interval ${} U' {}$ containing ${} x$, and ${} U=\mathbb{Q} \cap U' {}$. Now since $A$ is closed in ${} \mathbb{Q} {}$, then ${} U' {}$ must contain only irrational points, except for $x$. However, if ${} a,\, b \in U' {}$ are irrational, then there must exist some ${} y \in U' {}$ with ${} a<y<b {}$, and ${} y {}$ rational. Therefore, ${} U \cap A\neq \varnothing  {}$, and ${} x \in \conj{A}\neq A {}$. Therefore, ${} \{ x \} {}$ is not open, and ${} \mathbb{Q} {}$ is not discrete.

First, let ${} x,\, y \in K {}$ and ${} n,\, m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Then if ${} z \in B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right) {}$, then ${} d(x,\, z)<\frac{1}{n} {}$ and ${} d(y,\, z)<\frac{1}{m} {}$. Now let ${} \ell=\max(m,\, n) {}$. Then if ${} d(a,\, z)<\frac{1}{\ell} {}$, then $a$ and $z$ agree on their first $\ell$ digits, and so $a$ and $x$ agree on their first $n$ digits and ${} a {}$ and $y {}$ agree on their first $m {}$ digits. Therefore, ${} a \in B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right)  {}$, and so
$$
B\left( z; \frac{1}{\max(n,\, m)} \right) \subseteq  B\left( x; \frac{1}{n}  \right) \cap B\left( y; \frac{1}{m}  \right) {}
$$
Therefore the balls form a basis for a topology ${} \mathcal{T}' {}$. Let the induced topology be $\mathcal{T} {}$, and let
$$
\mathscr{B}=\{ B(x;1/n) \mid  x \in K,\, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \}
$$

Now let ${} B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right) \in \mathscr{B} {}$, and ${} y \in B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right) {}$. Now let ${} d=\frac{1}{n}-|x-y| {}$. Take ${} U'=\{ r \in \mathbb{R}\mid |y- r|<d \} {}$, and ${} U=K \cap  U' {}$. Now if ${} z \in U {}$, then
$$
\begin{align}
 |y-z| & <\frac{1}{n}-|x-y|   \\
|x-y|+|y-z|  & <\frac{1}{n} \\
|x-z|  & <\frac{1}{n}
 \end{align}
$$
and so $x {}$ and $z {}$ agree on at least $n$ digits. Therefore, ${} z \in B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right) {}$, and 
$$
y \in U \subseteq B\left( x;\frac{1}{n} \right)
$$
The converse follows similarly. 
5. 
Let ${} S \subseteq X {}$. Since $A$ is open in $B$, then ${} A=B \cap C {}$, with $C$ open in $X$. Then ${} A \cap S=(B \cap S) \cap  C {}$, and so ${} A \cap  S {}$ is still open in ${} B \cap  S {}$.
6. 
Suppose that $A {}$ is open (closed). Then ${} A=Y_{1} \cap M {}$ and ${} A=Y_{2} \cap N {}$ for open (closed) ${} M,\, N {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
(Y_{1} \cup  Y_{2}) \cap (M \cap  N) & =((Y_{1} \cap  M) \cap  N) \cup ((Y_{2} \cap  N) \cap  M) \\
 & =(A \cap  N)  \cup (A \cap  M) \\
 & =A
\end{align}
$$
since ${} M \cap N {}$ is open (closed), then ${} A {}$ is open (closed) in ${} Y_{1} \cup  Y_{2} {}$. 
7. 
We have that ${} U=M \cap A {}$, with $M$ open in ${} X {}$. Now $\mathscr{C}A$ is open, and
$$
\begin{align}
U \cup (V-A) & =(M \cap  A )\cup (V \cap  \mathscr{C}A) \\
 & =(V \cup (M \cap  A))\cap  (\mathscr{C}A \cup (M \cap A)) \\
 & =V \cap ((M \cup \mathscr{C}A) \cap (\mathscr{C}A \cup A)) \\
 & =V \cap (M \cup \mathscr{C}A)
\end{align}
$$
and since ${} V,\, M,\, \mathscr{C}A {}$ are open, then ${} U \cup (V-A) {}$ is open.

b) 
Let ${} x \in \conj{B} {}$. Then if $U {}$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ in ${} \conj{B} {}$, then ${} U=U' \cap \conj{B} {}$. Then ${} U' {}$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ over $X {}$, and ${} U' \cap  B {}$ is non-empty. Now ${} U' \cap B {}$ is open in $B$, and therefore contains an element of $A$, so $U$ contains an element of $A$. Therefore, ${} x \in \conj{A} {}$, and ${} \conj{A}=\conj{B} {}$ and $A$ is dense in ${} \conj{B} {}$.
