1. 
Let $N {}$ be the set of element without a maximal element. Then each chain ${} \mathcal{C} {}$ in ${} N {}$ has a upper bound $u {}$ in ${} N$, as if ${} u \notin N {}$, then there exists some maximal $m\succ u$, and by transitivity, ${} m \succ c, c \in \mathcal{C} {}$. Therefore, there exists some maximal element ${} m \in N {}$. Now suppose that $x \succ m$ for some ${} x \in X {}$. If ${} x \in N {}$, then ${} m \succ x {}$. Otherwise, if ${} x \in X-N {}$, then there exists some maximal ${} M \succ x {}$, and ${} m \notin N {}$ by transitivity. Therefore, $m$ is maximal, and so by contradiction ${} N=\varnothing {}$
2. 
a)
Let $X {}$ be a preordered set under ${} \succ$, and let ${} \mathscr{F} {}$ be the set of all well ordered non-empty subsets of $X {}$. Given ${} A \in \mathscr{F} {}$, pick ${} a_{A} {}$ as an upper bound of $A$, and set
$$
T_{A}=\{ x \in X \mid  x \succ a_{A} \wedge \neg(a_{A}  \succ  x)  \}
$$
Now suppose that for all ${} A \in \mathscr{F} {}$, ${} T_{A}\neq  \varnothing  {}$. Therefore, there exists a function
$$
c: \mathscr{F} \to{}\bigcup_{A\in \mathscr{F}}T_{A}
$$
with ${} c(A) \in T_{A} {}$. If we set ${} c(\varnothing )=x_{0} {}$ for some arbitrary ${} x_{0} \in X {}$, then ${} \mathscr{F}' =\mathscr{F} \cup \{  \varnothing  \} {}$ is a $c- {}$tower. In particular, 
1. ${} \varnothing  \in \mathscr{F} {}$
2. 
If ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{F}' {}$ is a chain ordered by inclusion, then given any ${} a,\, b \in \bigcup \mathscr{A} {}$, there exists well ordered sets ${} A,\, B \in \mathscr{A} {}$ with ${} a \in A {}$, and ${} b \in B {}$. Therefore, ${} a,\, b \in  A \cup B {}$, and so either ${} a \succ b {}$ or ${} b \succ a {}$, so ${} A \cup  B {}$ is totally ordered. 

Now let ${} A \subseteq  \bigcup \mathscr{A} {}$. Suppose that $A$ does not have a first element. Then if ${} x \in A {}$, then there exists some ${} a \in A {}$ with ${} a \prec x \wedge \neg (x \prec a) {}$. However, ${} x \in B \in \mathscr{A} {}$, and so there exists some first ${} b \in B {}$

If ${} A,\, B {}$ are preordered, then we say that ${} A {}$ continues $B {}$ write ${} A \sqsubseteq B {}$ iff ${} A \subseteq B {}$, and ${} x \in A {}$ and ${} y \in B {}$ with $y\prec x {}$, then ${} y \in A {}$. It is clear that ${} \sqsubseteq  {}$ is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric, so ${} \sqsubseteq  {}$ is a partial order.

Let ${} X {}$ be a preordered set, and let ${} \mathscr{F} \subseteq \mathscr{P}(X) {}$, and ${} \varphi: \mathscr{F}\to{}X {}$ be a map with $\varphi(A)\succ x {}$ for all ${} x \in A {}$, with the following properties:
1. ${} \varnothing  \in \mathscr{F} {}$
2. If ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{F} {}$ is a chain w.r.t. ${} \sqsubseteq  {}$, we say that $\mathscr{A} {}$ is a non-decreasing chain, and have that ${} \bigcup  \mathscr{A} \in \mathscr{F} {}$.
3. If $A \in \mathscr{F} {}$, then ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} \in \mathscr{F} {}$.
Then $\mathscr{F}$ is called a $\varphi {}$-spire. 

Let ${} \mathscr{B}$ be a collection of $\varphi$-spires. Then note that
1. ${} \varnothing \in \bigcap \mathscr{B} {}$
2. If ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq  \bigcap  \mathscr{B} {}$ is a non-decreasing chain, then for each ${} \mathscr{F} \in \mathscr{B} {}$, we have that ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{F} {}$ is a non-decreasing chain, and so ${} \bigcup \mathscr{A} \in \mathscr{F} {}$, so ${} \bigcup \mathscr{A} \in \bigcap \mathscr{B} {}$
3. If ${} A \in \bigcap \mathscr{B} {}$, then for each ${} \mathscr{F} \in \mathscr{B} {}$, ${} A \in \mathscr{F} {}$, and ${} A \cup  \{ \varphi(A) \} \in \mathscr{F} {}$, so ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} \in \bigcap \mathscr{B} {}$
So ${} \bigcap \mathscr{B} {}$ is a $\varphi$-spire

Now let ${} \mathscr{M}= \bigcap \{ \mathscr{A} \in \mathscr{P}(\mathscr{P}(X))\mid \mathscr{A} \text{ is a }\varphi \text{-spire} \} {}$. Note that $\mathscr{M}$ is minimal, that is, if ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{M} {}$ is a $\varphi$-spire, then $\mathscr{A}=\mathscr{M} {}$. Now we wish to show that $\mathscr{M} {}$ is a non-decreasing chain ordered by continuation.

Call ${} M \subseteq  \mathscr{M} {}$ *medial* whenever, for all ${} A  \in \mathscr{M} {}$, ${} A \sqsubseteq  M \vee M \sqsubseteq  A {}$. First, we establish:

Let ${} M \in \mathscr{M} {}$ be medial. Then for all ${} A \in \mathscr{M} {}$, either ${} A \sqsubseteq  M {}$ or ${} M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq A {}$.
Proof:
Let ${} \mathscr{G}_{M}=\{ A \in \mathscr{M} \mid  A \sqsubseteq  M \vee  M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq  A \} {}$. Note:
1. ${} \varnothing \in \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$, as ${} \varnothing  \sqsubseteq  M {}$, vacuously
2. Let ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$ be an increasing chain. Then, either
	1. There exists some ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$ with ${} M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq A {}$. Then ${} M \cup  \{  \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq \bigcup \mathscr{A} {}$.
	2. For all ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$, ${} A \sqsubseteq  M {}$. Then ${} \bigcup \mathscr{A} \sqsubseteq  M {}$.
3. Let ${} A \in \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$. Then either
	1. ${} M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq  A {}$. Then, clearly, ${} M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \sqsubseteq  A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} {}$, as $\varphi(A)$and ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} \in \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$
	2. ${} A \subseteq M {}$. Then, since $M {}$ is medial, and ${} A \cup \{ \varphi (A) \} \in \mathscr{M} {}$, then either
		1. ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} \subseteq M {}$. Then clearly  ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \}  \in \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$
		2. ${} M \subseteq A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \} {}$. Then, since ${} A \subseteq M {}$, then either ${} A=M {}$, or ${} A \cup \{ \varphi(A) \}=M {}$. In either case, then ${} A \cup  \{  \varphi(A) \} \in \mathscr{G}_{M} {}$. 
Therefore, ${} \mathscr{G}_{M}$ is a $\varphi {}$-spire, and since ${} \mathscr{G}_{M} \subseteq \mathscr{M} {}$, and ${} \mathscr{M}$ is minimal, then ${} \mathscr{M}=\mathscr{G}_{M} {}$. 

Now we show that all ${} M \in \mathscr{M} {}$ are medial. First, let ${} \mathscr{G}=\{ M \in \mathscr{M} \mid M \text{ is medial} \} {}$. First, 
1. ${} \varnothing  \in \mathscr{G} {}$, clearly.
2. Let ${} \mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{G} {}$ be an increasing chain. Then, if ${} M \in \mathscr{M} {}$, then since ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$ is medial, then either 
	1. For all ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$, ${} A \subseteq M {}$. Then ${} \bigcup \mathscr{A} \subseteq M {}$.
	2. There exists some ${} A \in \mathscr{A} {}$ with ${} M \subseteq A {}$. then ${} M \subseteq \bigcup \mathscr{A} {}$
3. Let ${} M \in \mathscr{G} {}$. Let any ${} A \in \mathscr{M} {}$. Since $M {}$ is medial, then by the above, either ${} A \subseteq M  {}$, and ${} A \subseteq M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} {}$, or ${} M \cup \{ \varphi(M) \} \subseteq A {}$. Therefore, ${} M \cup  \{  \varphi(M) \} {}$ is medial
Therefore, $\mathscr{G}$ is a $\varphi$-spire, and since ${} \mathscr{G} \subseteq \mathscr{M} {}$, then ${} \mathscr{G}=\mathscr{M} {}$, and $\mathscr{M}$ is totally ordered by inclusion.
