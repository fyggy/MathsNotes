1. 
Let $N {}$ be the set of element without a maximal element. Then each chain ${} \mathcal{C} {}$ in ${} N {}$ has a upper bound $u {}$ in ${} N$, as if ${} u \notin N {}$, then there exists some maximal $m\succ u$, and by transitivity, ${} m \succ c, c \in \mathcal{C} {}$. Therefore, there exists some maximal element ${} m \in N {}$. Now suppose that $x \succ m$ for some ${} x \in X {}$. If ${} x \in N {}$, then ${} m \succ x {}$. Otherwise, if ${} x \in X-N {}$, then there exists some maximal ${} M \succ x {}$, and ${} m \notin N {}$ by transitivity. Therefore, $m$ is maximal, and so by contradiction ${} N=\varnothing {}$
