Since for every point, there exists a pair of lines whose only intersection is that point, then every point is open, and so this defines the discrete topology

a)
Let $\mathscr{T}$ be a topology larger than every ${} \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} {}$. Then ${} \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \subseteq \mathscr{T} {}$ for all ${} \alpha \in \mathscr{A} {}$. Therefore, ${} \bigcup _{\alpha \in \mathscr{A}}\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \subseteq \mathscr{T} {}$, and so ${} \bigvee_{\alpha \in \mathscr{A}}\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \subseteq \mathscr{T} {}$.

c)
Let ${} \mathscr{T}=\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3}) {}$. Now if ${} A \in \mathscr{T} {}$, then ${} A \in \mathscr{T}_{1} {}$, and ${} A \in \mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} A=\bigcup _{\alpha} \bigcap _{\beta} A_{\alpha,\, \beta} {}$ for ${} A_{\alpha,\, \beta} \in \mathscr{T}_{1} \cup \mathscr{T}_{2} {}$ with $\beta {}$ finite. Therefore, each ${} A_{\alpha,\, \beta}$

Let ${} A \in (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2})\vee (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap  \mathscr{T}_{3}) {}$. Then ${} A = \bigcup _{\alpha} \bigcap _{\beta}A_{\alpha,\, \beta} {}$, for finite $\beta$ with ${} A_{\alpha,\, \beta} \in \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \cup \mathscr{T}_{3}) {}$.
