1. 
Suppose that ${} F_1 \subseteq F_{2} {}$. Let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} {}$ be a $K {}$-automorphism of $F_{2} {}$. Then since $F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$, then $\sigma F_{1}=F_{1} {}$, and so ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$.

Conversely, suppose that ${} H_{1} \supseteq H_{2} {}$. Then let ${} x \in F_{1} {}$. Since $F_{1}$ is the fixed field of $H_{1}$, then all ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \subseteq H_{1} {}$ fix $x$. Therefore, ${} x \in F_{2} {}$, since $F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$.
