1. 
Suppose that ${} F_1 \subseteq F_{2} {}$. Let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} {}$ be a ${} F_{2} {}$-automorphism of $E$. Then since ${} F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$, then $\sigma F_{1}=F_{1} {}$, and so ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$.

Conversely, suppose that ${} H_{1} \supseteq H_{2} {}$. Then let ${} x \in F_{1} {}$. Since $F_{1}$ is the fixed field of $H_{1}$, then all ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \subseteq H_{1} {}$ fix $x$. Therefore, ${} x \in F_{2} {}$, since $F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2} {}$.
2. 
First note that if ${} F_{1}=F_{2} {}$, then $H_{1}=H_{2} {}$. Likewise, if $H_{1}=H_{2} {}$, then ${} F_{1}=F_{2} {}$, by q1. Now let ${} \sigma \in \Gal(F_{2}F_{3}:E)  {}$. Then clearly ${} \sigma$ fixes ${} F_{2} {}$ and ${} F_{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. Conversely, let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. Then since ${} x \in F_{2}F_{3} {}$ is a quotient of a pair of finite sums of finite products of elements of ${} F_{2} {}$ and ${} F_{3} {}$, then $\sigma$ fixes $x$, and so ${} \sigma \in \Gal (F_{2}F_{3}:E) {}$. Therefore, ${} \Gal (F_{2}F_{3}:E)=H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. 
3. 
Let ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H) {}$. Then ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H_{2}) {}$ and ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H_{3}) {}$, so ${} x \in F_{2} \cap  F_{3} {}$. Conversely, let ${} x \in F_{2} \cap  F_{3} {}$, and let ${} \sigma \in H {}$. Then ${} \sigma=\sigma_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot\sigma_{n} {}$ where ${} \sigma_{i} \in H_{2} \cup H_{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma_{i}x=x {}$, and so ${} \sigma x=x {}$, and ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H) {}$. 
4. 
Let ${} A=\{ x \in X\mid GFx=x \} {}$ and ${} B=\{ y \in Y \mid  FGy=y \} {}$. Then ${} GFA=A {}$ and $FAB=B {}$. Therefore, ${} F':A\to{}B {}$ and ${} G':B\to{}A {}$ are mutually inverse and bijections. Furthermore, they are order reversing since both $F$ and $G$ are order reversing.
5. 
Let $\varphi:F\to{}F {}$ be defined by ${} x\mapsto x^{p} {}$. If ${} x \in \mathbb{Z}_{p} {}$, then ${} x=1+1+\dots +1 {}$, so ${} x^{p}=1^{p}+1^{p}+\dots+1^{p}=x {}$. Now suppose that ${} \varphi^{k}=1 {}$. Then since ${} F^{\times }$ is generated by some element $X$ satisfying ${} X^{p^{n}}=X {}$, then ${} \varphi^{k}(X)=X {}$, and so ${} X^{p^{k}} {}=X {}$, and $n \mid k$. Therefore, there are $n$ distinct powers of $\varphi$, and ${} \Gal(F : \mathbb{Z}_{p})=\langle \varphi \rangle  {}$.
6. 
Since ${} \varepsilon^{n}=1 {}$, then $K(\varepsilon)$ is the splitting field of ${} X^{n}-1 {}$ over $K$. Therefore, $K(\varepsilon)$ is normal over $K$, and since it is characteristic $0$, then it is separable and therefore $K(\varepsilon)$ is Galois over $K$. Now if $\alpha:K(\varepsilon)\to{}K(\varepsilon) {}$ is a $K$-automorphism, then ${} \alpha\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{k} {}$ for some $k$. Let $\beta$ be another $K {}$-automorphism defined by ${} \varepsilon\to{}\varepsilon^{\ell} {}$. Then ${} (\alpha\beta)\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{k+\ell}=\varepsilon^{\ell+k}=(\beta\alpha)\varepsilon {}$, and so ${} \Gal(K(\varepsilon) : K) {}$ is abelian.
