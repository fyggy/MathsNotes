1. 
Suppose that ${} F_1 \subseteq F_{2} {}$. Let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} {}$ be a ${} F_{2} {}$-automorphism of $E$. Then since ${} F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$, then $\sigma F_{1}=F_{1} {}$, and so ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$.

Conversely, suppose that ${} H_{1} \supseteq H_{2} {}$. Then let ${} x \in F_{1} {}$. Since $F_{1}$ is the fixed field of $H_{1}$, then all ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \subseteq H_{1} {}$ fix $x$. Therefore, ${} x \in F_{2} {}$, since $F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$.

Suppose that $F_{1}=F_{2}F_{3} {}$. Then if ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$ is a $F_{1} {}$-automorphism of ${} E {}$, then let ${} x \in F_{2} {}$ and ${} y \in F_{3} {}$. Note that ${} x \in F_{1} {}$ and ${} y \in F_{1} {}$, so ${} \sigma x=x {}$ and ${} \sigma y=y {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma \in H_{2} {}$ and ${} \sigma \in H_{3} {}$. Conversely, if ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \cap H_{3} {}$, then by the properties of homomorphisms, ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$. Therefore, ${} H_{1}=H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$.

Conversely, suppose that ${} H_{1}=H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. Let ${} x \in F_{2}F_{3} {}$. Then ${} \sigma x=x {}$ for ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$, as $x$ is the quotient of a finite sum of finite products of $F_{2}$ and $F_{3}$. Therefore, ${} x \in F_{1} {}$. Conversely, if ${} x \in F_{1} {}$, then
