1. 
Suppose that ${} F_1 \subseteq F_{2} {}$. Let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} {}$ be a ${} F_{2} {}$-automorphism of $E$. Then since ${} F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2}$, then $\sigma F_{1}=F_{1} {}$, and so ${} \sigma \in H_{1} {}$.

Conversely, suppose that ${} H_{1} \supseteq H_{2} {}$. Then let ${} x \in F_{1} {}$. Since $F_{1}$ is the fixed field of $H_{1}$, then all ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \subseteq H_{1} {}$ fix $x$. Therefore, ${} x \in F_{2} {}$, since $F_{2}$ is the fixed field of $H_{2} {}$.
2. 
First note that if ${} F_{1}=F_{2} {}$, then $H_{1}=H_{2} {}$. Likewise, if $H_{1}=H_{2} {}$, then ${} F_{1}=F_{2} {}$, by q1. Now let ${} \sigma \in \Gal(F_{2}F_{3}:E)  {}$. Then clearly ${} \sigma$ fixes ${} F_{2} {}$ and ${} F_{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. Conversely, let ${} \sigma \in H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. Then since ${} x \in F_{2}F_{3} {}$ is a quotient of a pair of finite sums of finite products of elements of ${} F_{2} {}$ and ${} F_{3} {}$, then $\sigma$ fixes $x$, and so ${} \sigma \in \Gal (F_{2}F_{3}:E) {}$. Therefore, ${} \Gal (F_{2}F_{3}:E)=H_{2} \cap  H_{3} {}$. 
3. 
Let ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H) {}$. Then ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H_{2}) {}$ and ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H_{3}) {}$, so ${} x \in F_{2} \cap  F_{3} {}$. Conversely, let ${} x \in F_{2} \cap  F_{3} {}$, and let ${} \sigma \in H {}$. Then ${} \sigma=\sigma_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot\sigma_{n} {}$ where ${} \sigma_{i} \in H_{2} \cup H_{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma_{i}x=x {}$, and so ${} \sigma x=x {}$, and ${} x \in \Fix_{E}(H) {}$. 
4. 
Let ${} A=\{ x \in X\mid GFx=x \} {}$ and ${} B=\{ y \in Y \mid  FGy=y \} {}$. Then ${} GFA=A {}$ and $FAB=B {}$. Therefore, ${} F':A\to{}B {}$ and ${} G':B\to{}A {}$ are mutually inverse and bijections. Furthermore, they are order reversing since both $F$ and $G$ are order reversing.
5. 
 Note that the subfields of ${} GF(p^{n}) {}$ are ${} GF(p^{k}) {}$, where ${} k \mid n {}$. Therefore, the lattice of subgroups of ${} G=\Gal(GF(p^{n}) : \mathbb{Z}_{p}) {}$ is a chain of length ${} \phi(n) {}$, and ${} G$ is cyclic.
