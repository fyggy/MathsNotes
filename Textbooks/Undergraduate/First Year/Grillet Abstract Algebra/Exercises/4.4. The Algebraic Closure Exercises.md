Suppose that $K$ is algebraically closed and finite. Then ${} \Char K>0 {}$, and so, by proposition III.8.13, $K[X]$ contains infinitely many monic irreducible polynomials. However, these cannot all be polynomials of degree $1$, as there are only finitely many of those. Therefore, there must be irreducible polynomials without degree $1$, which contradicts the algebraic closure of $K$.
