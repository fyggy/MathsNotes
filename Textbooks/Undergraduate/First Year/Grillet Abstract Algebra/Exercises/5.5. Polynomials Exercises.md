1. 
Let $K=\mathbb{Q} {}$, let ${} E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}) {}$, and let ${} F=\bar{\mathbb{Q}} {}$. Clearly, $F$ is normal over $K$, but ${} \sigma:\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\to{}\bar{\mathbb{Q}} {}$ mapping ${} \sqrt[3]{2}\mapsto \sqrt[3]{2} \varepsilon {}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a primitive third root of unity, maps ${} \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\to{}\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}\varepsilon) {}$, which is a complex valued, field. Clearly, this is not equal, so ${} \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}) {}$ is not normal over $\mathbb{Q} {}$

The discriminant of a monic separable degree ${} 3 {}$ polynomial in ${} K[X] {}$ with roots ${} \alpha_{1},\, \alpha_{2},\, \alpha_{3} \in \bar{K} {}$ is
$$
\Dis f=(\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2})^{2}(\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{3})^{2}(\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{3})^{2}
$$
Suppose that all of ${} \alpha_{i} {}$ are real. Then ${} \Dis f {}$ is positive, clearly. Now if one of ${} \alpha_{i}$, say, $\alpha_{1} {}$, is complex, then some ${} \alpha_{j} {}$, say, ${} \alpha_{2}=\conj{\alpha_{1}} {}$. Furthermore, $\alpha_{3} {}$ may not be complex, as ${} \alpha_{3}=\conj{\alpha_{3}} {}$. Now ${} \alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}=2\im \alpha_{1} {}$, so ${} (\alpha_{1}-\alpha 2)^{2}<0 {}$. Now 
$$
\begin{align}
 ( (\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{3})(\conj{\alpha_{1}}-\alpha_{3}) )^{2}  & =(\alpha_{1} \conj{\alpha_{1}}-\alpha_{3}(\alpha_{1}+\conj{\alpha_{1}})+\alpha_{3}^{2}) ^{2}>0
 \end{align}
$$
so ${} \Dis f<0 {}$. Therefore, if the discriminant of a cubic is positive, then there are $3 {}$ real distinct roots, if it is negative then there are ${} 2$ distinct complex roots and $1$ real root, and if it is zero then there is at least $1$ repeated root.
