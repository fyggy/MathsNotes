1. 
Let ${} f /p^{r}=g/ q^{s} {}$ with ${} p,\, q {}$ monic irreducible and ${} r,\, s \geq 1 {}$, and ${} \deg f<\deg p,\, \deg g<\deg q {}$. Then ${} fq^{s}=gp^{r} {}$. Now ${} \gcd(f,\, p)=1 {}$, as ${} \deg f <\deg p {}$, so ${} p \nmid f {}$, and $p$ is irreducible. Likewise, ${} \gcd(g,\, q)=1 {}$. Then we have that ${} f \mid gp^{r} {}$, and so ${} f \mid g {}$. Likewise, ${} g \mid fq^{s} {}$, and so ${} g\mid f  {}$. Therefore, ${} g=f {}$. 

Now ${} p^{r}=q^{s} {}$. Since they have a unique decomposition, and both $p$ and $q {}$ are irreducible, the  ${} p=q {}$ and ${} r=s {}$.

Clearly, if ${} k=1 {}$, then ${} a=a_{1} {}$. Otherwise, if the proposition holds for all ${} k <n {}$, then we have unique ${} p, r {}$ with non-zero $p {}$ such that
$$
a=pq+r
$$and ${} \deg r<\deg q {}$. Now
$$
\frac{a}{q^{n}}=\frac{r}{q^{n}}+\frac{p}{q^{n-1}}=\frac{r}{q^{n}}+\frac{a_{1}}{q}+\frac{a_{2}}{q^{2}}+\dots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{q^{n-1}}
$$
suffices, and the proposition holds for all ${} k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$.
