Suppose that $\mathfrak{A}$ is a prime ideal of a commutative ring ${} R {}$. Now let ${} A,\, B \in R / \mathfrak{A} {}$ with ${} AB=0 {}$. Now we have ${} a,\, b \in R {}$ with $a\mathfrak{A}=A {}$ and ${} b \mathfrak{A}=B {}$, so ${} ab \mathfrak{A} = \mathfrak{A} {}$, that is, ${} ab \in \mathfrak{A} {}$. Therefore, ${} a \in \mathfrak{A} {}$ or ${} b \in \mathfrak{A} {}$. In either case, either ${} A=\mathfrak{A}=0 {}$ or ${} B=\mathfrak{A}=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} R /\mathfrak{A} {}$ is a domain. 

Now suppose that $\mathfrak{A}$ is an ideal of $R$, and that ${} R / \mathfrak{A} {}$ is a domain. Then given ${} a,\, b \in R$ with ${} ab \in \mathfrak{A} {}$, we have that ${} a \mathfrak{A} b \mathfrak{A}=\mathfrak{A} {}$, that is, ${} AB=0 {}$ for some ${} A,\,  B\in R / \mathfrak{A} {}$. Therefore, either ${} A=0 {}$ or ${} B=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} a \in \mathfrak{A} {}$ or ${} b \in  \mathfrak{A} {}$, and $\mathfrak{A}$ is prime.

Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring and $\mathfrak{A}$ a maximal ideal. Then ${} R / \mathfrak{A} {}$ is a field, and since fields are domains, then $\mathfrak{A}$ is prime.
