1. 
Let ${} \alpha \in \conj{K} {}$. Suppose that ${} \alpha \in K^{1 /p^{\infty }} {}$, and let $\sigma$ be a $K$-automorphism of ${} \conj{K} {}$. Then ${} \alpha^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for some minimal ${} m {}$, and so ${} \sigma(\alpha)^{p^{m}}=\sigma(\alpha^{p^{m}})=\alpha^{p^{m}} {}$. Since ${} {p^{m}}^{\text{th}} {}$ roots are unique, then this implies that $\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha {}$.

Now suppose that, for every ${} K {}$-automorphism $\sigma$ of ${} \conj{K}$, ${} \sigma(\alpha)=\alpha {}$. Then $\sigma$ restricts to the identity on ${} K(\alpha)$. Now if ${} \varphi:K(\alpha)\to{}\conj{K} {}$ is a $K$-homomorphism, then $\varphi$ extends to a $K {}$-automorphism $\psi {}$ of ${} \conj{K} {}$, and so $\varphi$ is the identity. Therefore, ${} [K(\alpha):K]_{s}=1 {}$, and $\alpha$ is purely inseparable over $K {}$. Thus ${} \alpha \in K^{1 /p^{\infty }} {}$.

Let ${} x \in K(S) {}$. Then 
$$
x=F((s_{i})_{i \in I})
$$
for some ${} F \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$ with ${} s_{i} \in S {}$. Then 
$$
x^{p^{m}}=G((s_{i}^{p^{m}})_{i \in I})
$$
where $G$ is $F$ with the coefficients raised to the power ${} p^{m}$. Then there exists some $m$ such that ${} s_{i}^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for all ${} i \in I {}$. Then ${} x^{p^{m}} \in K {}$, as every element on the right hand side is an element of $K$. Therefore, $x {}$ is purely inseparable over ${} K$, and $K(S)$ is purely inseparable over $K$.
4. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be algebraic extensions. Now if $F$ is purely inseparable over $K$, then if ${} x \in E {}$, then ${} x \in F {}$, and so $x$ is purely inseparable over $K$, and $E$ is purely inseparable over $K$. Then if ${} x \in F {}$, then ${} x^{p^{m}}  \in K \subseteq E {}$ for some $m$, and so $x$ is purely inseparable over $E$.
5. 
We have that ${} [F:E]_{s}=[E:K]_{s}=1 {}$, and so
$$
[F:K]_{s}=[F:E]_{s}[E:K]_{s}=1
$$
and so $F$ is purely inseparable over $K$. 
6. 
We have that $EF=KF(E) {}$. Let ${} x \in E {}$. Since $E$ is purely inseparable over $K$, then ${} x^{p^{m}}\in K \subseteq KF {}$ for some $m$. Therefore, $E$ is purely inseparable over $KF$, and so $EF$ is purely inseparable over ${} KF {}$
7. 
Let ${} (E_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be a family of purely inseparable extensions over ${} K$. Then ${} S=\bigcup_{i\in I} E_{i} {}$ is a set such that every ${} \alpha \in S {}$ is purely inseparable over $K {}$. Now
$$
\prod _{i \in I} E_{i}=K(S)
$$
and $K(S)$ is purely inseparable over $K$.
