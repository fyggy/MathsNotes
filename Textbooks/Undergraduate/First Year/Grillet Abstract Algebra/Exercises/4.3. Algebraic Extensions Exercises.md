1. 
Let $S$ such that all ${} \alpha \in S {}$ are algebraic over $K {}$. Let ${} x \in K(S)$. Then we have that
$$
x=\sum _{i \in I} k_{i} \prod _{j \in J} s_{i,\, j}
$$
with ${} k_{i} \in K {}$ and ${} s_{i,\, j} \in S {}$, and $I,\, J {}$ are finite. Then let ${} T=\{ s_{i,\, j} \mid i \in I,\, j \in J\} {}$ is finite, and $K(T) {}$ is algebraic over $K {}$. Therefore, since ${} x \in K(T) {}$, then $x$ is algebraic over ${} K {}$.
2. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $F$ is algebraic over $K$. Then if ${} e \in E {}$, then ${} e \in F {}$ and $e$ is algebraic over $K$. Furthermore, if ${} f \in F {}$, then there exists a polynomial ${} g \in K[X] \subseteq E[X] {}$ such that ${} g(f)=0 {}$. Therefore, $F$ is algebraic over $E$.
3. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$ be fields, and suppose that $E$ is algebraic over $K$, and $F$ is algebraic over $E$. Now if ${} x \in F {}$, then there exists ${} f=\Irr(x:E) \in E[X] {}$ such that ${} f(x)=0 {}$. Then if ${} a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n} {}$ are the coefficients of $f {}$, then ${} x$ is algebraic over ${} K(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) {}$. Therefore ${} [K(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n})(x):K(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n})] {}$ is finite, and ${} [K(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n}):K] {}$ is finite since $E {}$ is algebraic over $K$. Therefore, ${} [K(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n})(x):K] {}$ is finite, and so $x$ is algebraic over $K {}$. Therefore, $F$ is algebraic over $K$.
4. 
Let ${} x \in EF {}$. Then ${} x=ab^{-1} {}$, with ${} a,\, b \in E[F] {}$. Then we have
$$
\begin{align}
a & =\sum_{i \in I} a_{i}f_{i} &  & a_{i} \in E,\, f_{i} \in F \\
b & =\sum_{i \in J} b_{i}g_{i} &  & b_{i} \in E,\, g_{i} \in F
\end{align}
$$
with ${} I,\, J {}$ finite, and so ${} a \in KF((a_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$. Since each ${} a_{i}$ is algebraic over ${} K \subseteq KF {}$, then this is an algebraic extension, and so $a$ is algebraic over $KF$. Likewise, so is $b$. Therefore, ${} x \in KF(a,\, b) {}$ is algebraic, and so $EF$ is algebraic over $KF {}$.
5. 
Let ${} (E_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be a family of algebraic extensions of $K$. Now let ${} E= \prod_{i\in I} E_{i} {}$. Then if ${} x \in E {}$, then ${} x=ab^{-1} {}$, where ${} a,\, b \in F {}$, where $F {}$ is the ring of finite sums of finite products of elements of ${} \bigcup_{i\in I} E_{i} {}$, all of which's elements are algebraic over $K {}$. Let ${} A$ be the set of elements involved in this finite sum of finite products for $a$, and $B {}$ for ${} b {}$ likewise. Then $K(A)$ is an algebraic extension, as all elements are algebraic, and ${} a \in K(A) {}$ is therefore algebraic. Likewise, ${} b \in K(B) {}$ is algebraic, and so ${} x \in K(a,\, b) {}$ is algebraic over $K$. Therefore, $E$ is algebraic over $K$.
6. 
Let ${} (E_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be a finite family of finite extensions of $K$. Let ${} E=\prod_{i\in I} E_{i} {}$. Let ${} \left( \{ a_{j}^{i} \}_{j=1}^{k_{i}}  \right)_{i \in I} {}$ be the finite set of finite bases of the ${} E_{i} {}$, and let ${} \mathcal{B}=\{ b_{i} \}_{i=1}^{k}  {}$ be the union of these bases. This is a finite set. We show that it is a generating set. 

Let ${} x \in E {}$. Since $E$ is algebraic over $K$, then ${} x=f((s_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$, where ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$ and ${} s_{i} \in E_{j} {}$ for some $j {}$. Then each element has ${} s_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}m_{i,\, j}b_{j} {}$, with ${} m_{i,\, j} \in K {}$ and ${} x$ is a sum of products of coefficients in $K$ and powers of basis elements. Since each basis element is itself an element of some ${} E_{i} {}$, then its powers are expressible as a linear combination in ${} \mathcal{B}$. Therefore, $x$ is expressible as a linear combination in $\mathcal{B}$, and $\mathcal{B}$ is a finite basis for $E$. Therefore, $E$ is finite over $K$.
