1. 
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a chain of algebraically independent subsets of ${} E \supseteq K {}$. Let ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ be the union of $\mathcal{C}$. Now let ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Then ${} f \in K[(X_{j})_{j \in J}] {}$, where $J {}$ is a finite subset of $I$. Therefore, there exists a ${} (\beta_{\ell})_{\ell \in L}  \in \mathcal{C} {}$ such that ${} (\alpha_{j})_{j \in J} \subseteq (\beta_{\ell})_{\ell \in L} {}$, and since the ${} \beta_{\ell}$ are algebraically independent, then ${} f((\alpha_{i})_{i \in I})=f((\alpha_{j})_{j \in J})=0 {}$ iff ${} f=0 {}$, and the ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are algebraically independent.

Let $S$ be algebraically independent over $K$, and let $\beta$ be transcendental over $K(S)$. Then let ${} T=S \cup \{ \beta \} {}$, and let ${} f \in K[(X_{t})_{t \in T}] {}$ be non-zero. Then ${} f \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}][X_{\beta}] {}$, and so 
$$
f(T)=\sum _{i =0}^{n} f_{i}(S)\beta^{i}
$$
where ${} f_{i} \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}] {}$. Since $S$ is algebraically independent, and not all ${} f_{i}=0 {}$, then not all ${} f_{i}(S)=0 {}$, and so 
$$
f(T)=\tilde{f}(\beta)
$$
where ${} \tilde{f} \in K[X_{\beta}] {}$. Now since the ${} f_{i}(S) \in K(S) {}$, and $\beta$ is transcendental over $K(S)$, and ${} \tilde{f}\neq 0 {}$, then ${} f(T)=\tilde{f}(\beta)\neq 0 {}$. Therefore, $T$ is algebraically independent over $K$.
3. 
Let $S {}$ be algebraically independent over ${} K {}$, and let ${} \beta \in S {}$. Then let ${} T=S - \{ \beta \} {}$, and let ${} f \in K(T)[X] {}$ be non-zero. Suppose that ${} f(\beta)=0 {}$. Then if ${} (a_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are the coefficients of $f$, then
$$
a_{i}=\frac{f_{i}(T)}{g_{i}(T)}
$$
for ${} f_{i},\, g_{ i} \in K[(X_{t})_{t \in T}] {}$. Now 
$$
g=f\cdot \prod _{i \in I} g_{i}
$$
is a non-zero polynomial in ${} K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}] {}$, and 
$$
g(S)=f(\beta) \cdot \prod _{i \in I}g_{i}(S)=0
$$
contradicting the algebraic independence of $S$. Therefore, ${} f(\beta)\neq 0 {}$, and $\beta$ is algebraically independent of ${} K(T) {}$.

Conversely, suppose that for all ${} \beta \in S {}$, and ${} T_{\beta}=S - \{ \beta \} {}$, then $\beta {}$ is transcendental over ${} K(T_{\beta}) {}$. Now if ${} f \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S}] {}$ is a non-zero polynomial, then for some ${} \beta \in S {}$ then ${} f \in K[(X_{t})_{t \in T_{\beta}}][X_{\beta}] {}$, and ${} f(T_{\beta}) \in K(T_{\beta})[X_{\beta}] {}$, so ${} f(T_{\beta})(\beta)=0 {}$ iff ${} f(T_{\beta})=0 {}$. This is impossible, as that would require every polynomial making up the coefficients to be zero

We use transfinite induction. Well order $S {}$ by ${} {}{\leq}{} {}$, and let ${} \Lambda=\ord(S) {}$. Then we have a map $\beta:\Lambda\to{}S$ a order isomorphism, and denote $\beta(\alpha)=\beta_{\alpha} {}$. 

Now consider ${} \beta_{0}$. Then $\beta_{0}$ is transcendental over $K$, and ${\beta_{0}} {}$ is algebraically independent. Now suppose that, given ${} \mu \in \Lambda {}$, then ${} S_{\mu}=\{ b_{\alpha} \mid  \alpha <\mu \} {}$ is algebraically independent. Then we have that ${} \beta_{\mu} {}$ is transcendental over ${} K(S_{\mu}) {}$. Therefore, let ${} T=S_{\mu} \cup  \{ \beta_{\mu} \} {}$, and let ${} \tilde{f} \in K[(X_{t})_{t \in T}] {}$ be non-zero. Then this induces, via rearranging, a ${} f \in K[(X_{s})_{s \in S_{\mu}}][X_{\beta_{\mu}}] {}$, and ${} f(S_{\mu}) \in K(S_{\mu})[X_{\beta_{\mu}}] {}$. Since ${} \beta_{\mu} {}$ is transcendental over $K(S_{\mu})$, then ${} f(S_{\mu}) {}(\beta_{\mu})=0 {}$ iff ${} f(S_{\mu})=0 {}$. This would imply that the polynomials making up the coefficients of ${} f {}$ are all ${} 0, {}$ since $S_{\mu}$ is algebraically independent. However, this is impossible unless ${} \tilde{f} {}$ itself is $0$. Therefore, ${} T=S_{\mu} \cup \{ \beta_{\mu} \} {}$ is algebraically independent, and so $S$ is algebraically independent, by transfinite induction.
