1. 
We have that the roots of ${} X^{3}-2 {}$ are ${} \sqrt[3]{2},\, \sqrt[3]{2}e^{2\pi i/3},\, \sqrt[3]{2}e^{4\pi i/3} {}$. Then ${} \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\, e^{2\pi i/3}) {}$ is the splitting field of ${} X^{3}-2 {}$
2. 
The roots of ${} X^{4}+5X^{2}+6 {}$ are ${} -i\sqrt{2},\, i\sqrt{2},\, -i\sqrt{3},\, i\sqrt{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} \mathbb{Q}(i,\, \sqrt{2},\, \sqrt{3}) {}$ is the splitting field of

Let $K$ be a field that contains a subfield of order ${} p^{n}$. Then that field is isomorphic to ${} GF(p^{n}) {}$, and so every element is a root of ${} X^{p^{n}}-X {}$. Since that is ${} p^{n}$ elements, then ${} X^{p^{n}}-X {}$ splits in $K$. Conversely, if ${} X^{p^{n}}-X {}$ splits in $K$, then its roots must form a subfield, and since there are ${} p^{n}$ distinct roots, then $K$ has a subfield of order ${} p^{n}$. 

Now let ${} E,\, F \subseteq K {}$ be subfields of order ${} p^{n}$. Then ${} E \cup F {}$ contains roots of ${} X^{p^{n}}-X {}$, and so ${} |E \cup F|\leq p^{n} {}$, so ${} E\cup F=E=F {}$.

Suppose that a field $K {}$ of order ${} p^{n} {}$ contains a subfield $E {}$ of order ${} p^{m}$. Then $K$ is the splitting field of ${} X^{p^{n}}-X {}$, and $E$ is the splitting field of ${} X^{p^{m}}-X {}$. Let ${} x \in E {}$. Then ${} x^{p^{n}}=x^{p^{m}}=x {}$. Therefore,
