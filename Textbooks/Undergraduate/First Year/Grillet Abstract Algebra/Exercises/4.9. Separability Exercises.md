1. 
We have that ${} F =K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\cong K((X_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$. First, suppose that the ${} ({} \chi_{i} {})_{i \in I} {}$ are algebraic over ${} E {}$. Then ${} K((\chi_{i})_{i \in I}) {}$ is algebraic over ${} E {}$, and by the tower property, we have a contradiction. Therefore, the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over ${} E {}$. 

Note that ${} F=Q(K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}]) {}$. Then the set of all monomials, ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$, is a basis of ${} F'=K[(\chi_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$. Since the ${} (\chi_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ are transcendental over $E$, then if ${} f \in K[(X_{i})_{i \in I}] {}$ is non-zero, then ${} f((\chi_{i})_{i \in I})\neq 0 {}$. Since each polynomial is a linear combination of the monomials of ${} F' {}$, then the ${} (M_{j})_{j \in J} {}$ are linearly independent over $E$. Therefore, $E$ and $F$ are linearly disjoint
2. 
Let $K$ be perfect, and let ${} K \subseteq E {}$ be a field extension. Note that if ${} x \in K^{1 /p ^{\infty }} {}$, then ${} x^{p^{m}} \in K {}$ for some $m$, and so ${} x \in K {}$. Therefore, ${} K^{1 /p^{\infty }} \subseteq K {}$. Now suppose that ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E {}$ are linearly independent over ${} K$. Therefore, they are linearly independent over ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and $E$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint. Therefore, $E {}$ is separable. 
3. 
Suppose that ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$, $E {}$ is separable over $K {}$, and that ${} F {}$ is separable over ${} E {}$. Now suppose that ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ is linearly independent over ${} K {}$. Then ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ is linearly independent over $E$, as $E$ is separable over $K$. Furthermore, since ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and is linearly independent over $E$, then ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} {}$ is linearly independent over $F$. Therefore, $F$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint over $K$, and $F$ is separable over $K$.

Let ${} K\subseteq E \subseteq L {}$ and ${} K\subseteq  F \subseteq L {}$ be fields with $E,\, F {}$ linearly disjoint over $K {}$. Now suppose that ${} A=\{\alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\} \subseteq  E {}$ are algebraically independent over ${} K$. Then the set of all finite products in $A$, $M$, is linearly independent over $K$. Therefore, $M$ is linearly independent over $F$, and so every polynomial in $A$ is non-zero. Therefore, $A$ is algebraically independent over $F$.
6. 
Let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq L {}$ and ${} K \subseteq F \subseteq L {}$ be fields with $E$ separable over $K$. Now suppose that ${} A=\{\alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}\} \subseteq  E {}$ algebraically independent over $K$ implies that $A$ is algebraically independent over $F$. Now let ${} (x_{j})_{j \in J}=S\subseteq EF {}$ be a finite set. then for each ${} x_{j} \in S {}$, we have 
$$
x_{j}= \frac{\sum_{i\in I} a_{i,j}m_{i,j}}{\sum_{i\in I} b_{i,j}n_{i,j}} 
$$
Now let ${} T=\{ a_{i,\, j} ,\, b_{i,\, j}\mid  i \in I,\, j \in J \} {}$. Since $I$ and $J {}$ are finite, then $T$ is finite and a subset of $E$. Then $E(T)$ has a separating transcendence base $B$. Then $B$ is algebraically independent over $F$ 
7. 
We have ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u^{1/p}) {}$, where $p$ is prime and $u {}$ is transcendental over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Then ${} u^{1/p} {}$ is transcendental over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and so ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u^{1/p}) {}$ is a purely transcendental field extension, and therefore it is separable over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}$. However, ${} u^{1/p} {}$ is algebraic over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u) {}$ with 
$$
\Irr(u^{1/p}:\mathbb{Z}_{p}(u))=X^{p}-u
$$
which is not separable. Therefore, ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u^{1/p}) {}$ is not separable over ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p}(u) {}$.
8. 
Let ${} K=\mathbb{Z}_{p} {}$ and ${} E=K(X,\, X^{1/p},\,\dots,\,X^{1/p^{r}},\,\dots) {}$. Now if ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in I} \subseteq E {}$ is linearly independent over $K$, and ${} (\gamma_{i})_{i \in I}  \subseteq K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ such that ${} \sum_{i\in I} \alpha_{i} \gamma_{i} {}$ is a linear combination, then at most finitely many ${} \gamma_{i}$ are non-zero: let ${} J \subseteq I {}$ be the set of all indices such that ${} \gamma_{i}$ are non zero. Then there exists some maximal ${} r {}$ such that
$$
(\alpha_{i})_{i \in J} \subseteq K(X,\,\dots,\,X^{1/p^{r}})=K(X^{1/p^{r}})
$$
Which is a purely transcendental extension. Therefore, ${} (\alpha_{i})_{i \in J} {}$ is linearly independent over ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$, and in particular ${} \sum_{i\in I} \alpha_{i}\gamma_{i}\neq 0 {}$ unless all ${} \gamma_{i}$ are zero. Therefore, $E$ and ${} K^{1/p^{\infty }} {}$ are linearly disjoint.

Let ${} K \subseteq E \subset L {}$ and ${} K \subseteq F \subseteq L {}$ be fields, with $E$ separable over $K {}$, and if some finite ${} A \subseteq E {}$ are algebraically independent over $K$, then they are algebraically independent over $F$. 

Now let ${} S \subseteq EF {}$ be finite. Then there exists finite sets ${} G \subseteq E {}$ and ${} H \subseteq F {}$, whose elements are those in $E$ and $F$ respectively which appear in some representation of each element of $S$. Then ${} K(S)=K(G \cup H)=F(G)=E(H) {}$. Since $G {}$ is finite, then there exists a separating transcendence base $B {}$ of ${} K(G)$ over $K$. Then $B {}$ is algebraically independent over ${} F {}$, and since ${} K(G) {}$ is algebraic and separable over $K(B)$, then ${} FK(G)=F(G)=F(S) {}$ is algebraic and separable over $F(B)$. Therefore, $B {}$ is a separating transcendence base of ${} F(S)$ over $F {}$, and $EF {}$ is separable over $F {}$.

Now suppose that ${} \alpha \in K(S) {}$ is transcendental over ${} K(B)$. Then $\alpha {}$ is a quotient of finite sum of finite products consisting of ${} \alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,\alpha_{n} \in G {}$ and ${} \beta_{1},\,\dots,\,\beta_{m} \in H {}$. If all the ${} \alpha_{i}$ are algebraic over $K(B) {}$, then at least one of the ${} \beta_{i}$ are transcendental over ${} K(B) {}$
