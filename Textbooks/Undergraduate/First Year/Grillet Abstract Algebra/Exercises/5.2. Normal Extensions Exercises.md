1. 
We have that ${} \Irr(\sqrt[3]{2}:\mathbb{Q})=x^{3}-2 {}$. It's other roots are therefore
$$
\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt[3]{4}},\, \frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt[3]{4}}
$$
which are the conjugates of ${} \sqrt[3]{2} {}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Let $F$ be normal over $K$ and let ${} K \subseteq E \subseteq F {}$. Let $\sigma$ be a $E {}$-automorphism of ${} \bar{E}=\bar{K} {}$. Then $\sigma$ is also a $K$-automorphism, and $\sigma F=F {}$, since $F$ is normal over $K$. Therefore, $F$ is normal over $E$.
4. 
Let $E$ be normal over $K$. Let $\sigma {}$ be a $KF {}$-automorphism of ${} \conj{KF}$. Then $\sigma$ may be restricted down to a $K$-automorphism of ${} \bar{K} {}$, and so $\sigma E=E {}$. Furthermore, since ${} F \subseteq KF {}$, then ${} \sigma F=F {}$. Therefore, ${} \sigma EF=EF {}$, and $EF$ is normal over $KF$.
5. 
Since $E$ and $F$ are normal over $K$, then every irreducible polynomial with a root in $E$ splits in $E$, and every irreducible polynomial with a root in $F$ splits in $F$. Then, if ${} f \in K[X] {}$ is an irreducible polynomial with a root in ${} E\cap F {}$, then $f$ splits in both $E$ and $F$. Therefore, $f$ splits in ${} E \cap F {}$, and so ${} E \cap  F {}$ is normal over $K$.

Suppose that ${} K^{1 /p^{\infty }}=K {}$. Then, for all ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ and ${} x \in K {}$, then ${} x^{p^{n}} {}$
