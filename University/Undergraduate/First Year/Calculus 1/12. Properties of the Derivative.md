### Theorem 1.1: 
All differentiable functions are continuous. 
We proved this last time
Now we ask: is every continuous function differentiable? The answer is no.
#### Example:
Let ${} f(x)=|x| {}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$
For ${} x>0 {}$, ${} f(x)=x {}$ which is continuous, same for $x<0 {}$
For ${} x=0 {}$, then we have
${} \lim_{x\tto 0^{+}} f(x)=\lim_{x\tto 0^{+}} x=0=f(0) {}$
${} \lim_{x\tto 0^{-}} f(x)=\lim_{x\tto 0^{-}} x=-0=f(0) {}$
So ${} f(x) {}$ is continuous at all $x$

However ${} f(x) {}$ is not differentiable
