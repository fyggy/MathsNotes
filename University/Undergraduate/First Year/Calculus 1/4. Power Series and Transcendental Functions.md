# Polynomials
## Recap
### Definition 1.1: Polynomials
Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}$. A polynomials function in $x$ of degree $n$ is a function that can be written in the form $$
f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x+a_{0}
$$
What about the domain and codomain? 
In this course, the domain and codomain are both $\mathbb{R}$, but in other courses they often take on different sets

### Definition 1.2: Informal definition of the derivative
This will be used to study polynomials. For now, we define $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}$ as an operator on functions, i.e. $$
\frac{d}{dx} :\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}\to{} \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}
$$
Since we only need this for polynomials, we only define it on polynomials
For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we define $\frac{d}{dx}x^{n}:=nx^{n-1}$. Extend this linearly to cover polynomials.
#### Examples:
$$
\begin{align}
 \frac{d}{dx} (x^{5}+x^{2}+1) & =5x^{4}+2x \\
\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} (x^{5}+x^{2}+1) & =20x^{3}+2
\end{align}
$$
### Evaluating Derivatives at $0$
If $f(x)=a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_{1}x+a_{0}$, then $f(0)=a_{0}$

Define $\displaystyle \left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=a}$ To be "differentiate then evaluate at $a$"
So now we have $\left.\frac{d}{dx}\right|_{x=0} f(x)$

$$
