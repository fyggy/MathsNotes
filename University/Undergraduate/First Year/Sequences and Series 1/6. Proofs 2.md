# Proof Methods
## Proof by Contradiction
### Example:
Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

#### Proof:
Suppose that there are only finitely many. Lets list them: $p_{1},p_{2},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$. Consider $n=p_{1}p_{2}\dots pk+1$. $n$ is not divisible by any prime in $p_{1},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$, as $n\equiv1 (\operatorname{mod} p_{i})$ for all $1\leq i\leq k$. Since $n\neq 1$, it is either a prime or has a prime factor less than $n$, which is different from all $p_{1},\,\dots,\,p_{k}$. Therefore, there is at least 1 prime that is not on that list. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes.

## Proof by Counterexample
### Example:
Prove that the statement "for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n^{2}$ is odd" is false.

#### Proof:
Let $n=2$. Then $n^{2}=4$ is not odd. Therefore, the statement is false$\square$.
