# The Integers

### Definition 1.1
Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$. we say $S$ is **bounded below** is there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n \leq s\ \forall\  s \in S$ 
We say that $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a least element of $S$ if
- $n\leq s \forall s \in S$ and
- $n \in S$

### The well-ordering principle
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ that is bounded below has a least element

Note that this is not true for $\mathbb{R}$. - $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid x>0 \}$ is bounded below, but has no least element

## Proof by Induction
### Theorem 2.1
Assume that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have a function $P(n)$, with $P:\mathbb{N}\to{} \{ \to{}p,\, \bot  \}$. Assume the following:
- $P(1)=\to{}p$                                                                      (assumption 1)
- $\forall n\geq 2,\, P(1),\, P(2),\, \dots,\, P(n-1) \Rightarrow P(n)$               (assumption 2)

Then $P(n)=\to{}p,\, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$

### Proof:
Let $S=\{ k \in \mathbb{N} \mid P(k)=\bot \}$. We want to show $S=\varnothing$
Assume by way of contradiction that $S\neq \varnothing$. Therefore, $S$ is bounded from below, as it a subset of the naturals, meaning that by the well-ordering principle is has a least element. Let the least element of $S$ be $m$

Since $P(1)=\to{}p$, then $1\notin S$ and since $m$ is a least element, then $2,\, 3,\, \dots,\, m-1\notin S$
By the definition of $S$ we have $P(2)=P(3)=\dots=P(m-1)=\to{}p$
But, by assumption 2, $P(m)$ is true. Therefore, $m \notin S$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $S=\varnothing$.

Note that we usually use $P(n-1)\Rightarrow P(n)$, instead of assumption 2

## Divisors
### Definition 3.1
Let $m,\, n \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that $m$ divides $n$ iff $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n=mk$

Notation: $m|n$ means "$m$ divides $n$"

Equivalent terms: 
- $m$ divides $n$
- $m$ is a divisor of $n$
- $n$ is a multiple of $m$
- $n$ is divisible by $m$

Note: that this means *integer* divisors. So under this definition, we have 4 divisors of $3$: $1,\, -1,\, 3,\, -3$.
Note: every integer is a divisor of $0$, as $0=0k \forall k\in \mathbb{Z}$

### Proposition 3.2
Let $a,\, b,\, c \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then:
1.  If $a|b$, and $b|c$, then $a|c$
2. If $a|n$, then $a\leq n$
3. If $c|a$, and $c|b$, then $c|(ax+by)$ for all $x,\, y \in \mathbb{Z}$

Proof of 1. and 2. are exercises

### Proof:
Assume $c|a$ and $c|b$
$c|a\Rightarrow a=ck$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
$c|b\Rightarrow b=cm$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$
we have $$
\begin{align}
ax+by & = (ck)x+(cm) \\
 & =c(kx)+c(my) \\
 & =c(kx+my)
\end{align}
$$
$kx+my \in \mathbb{Z}$
