# Intro to the Intro to the Intro
Admin stuff: 
Sessions:
- lectures - important, go over *all* material
- skill sessions - new, smaller, run by proper academic, going over homework problems
- tutorials - smallest, run by TAs, focus on writing proofs etc

KEATS:
edstem.org/us/courses/45510/discussion
In homework, questions marked with (SS) will be covered in skill sessions. Attempt them first

Tasks for before next lecture:
- [x] Find KEATS page
- [x] Sign up for ed discussion
- [x] meet someone else

<u>*WE DO HAVE SKILL SESSIONS*</u>

# Starting with the Maths
### What is this module about
Some sets:
- $\mathbb{Z}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$
- $\mathbb{R}$
- $\mathbb{C}$
- $M_{n}(\mathbb{R})$
- $\mathbb{R}[x]$

All these sets have addition and multiplication. These operations have some nice properties:
- associativity: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c),\,\,\,\, a(bc)=(ab)c$
- distributivity: $a(b + c) = ab + ac,\,\,\, (a + b)c = ac+bc$
These are all examples of rings - important


A group, however, has 1 operation.
examples include symmetries of geometric objects  
examples: 
- $SO_{3}(\mathbb{R})=\{\text{rotations of a sphere in } \mathbb{R}^{3}\}$
- $D_{3}=\{\text{symmetries of an equilateral triangle}\}$

## Background
### Sets

examples of useful sets:
- $\mathbb{N}$ - natural numbers. 0 is ***not*** included
- $\varnothing$ - empty set


Notation:
$$
\mathbb{C}=\{a+bi \mid a,\, b \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$
- The brackets $\{,\,\}$ denote that this is a set
- $a+bi$ takes all $a, b$ selected in $\mid$
- $\in$ - means "is an element of" (and $\notin$ means "not an element of")
- $|$ - means "such that"
Read out, the above reads "for all $a$ and $b$ in the set $\mathbb{R}$, the set $\mathbb{C}$ contains $a+bi$"

let $A$ and $B$ be 2 sets.
- $A \subseteq B$ - $A$ is a subset of $B$
- $A \cap B$ - Intersection
- $A\cup B$ - union
- $A\setminus B$ - complement, $\{a \mid a\in A, \, a \notin B\}$
- $A \times B = \{(a,\,b)\mid a \in A,\, b\in B\}$
- $|A|$ - number if elements of A
Fact: If A and B are finite sets:
$$
|A\times B|=|A|\cdot|B|
$$

Sets do not have duplicates: $\{2,\, 2,\, 3\}=\{2,\,3\}$
sets are unordered

If you have 3 sets $A,\, B,\, C$, then you can form
$A\times B\times C=\{a,\, b,\, c\mid a \in A,\, b\in B,\, c\in C \}$

### Functions
take $A,\, B$, sets
Definition 1.1: 
A function $f:A\to{} B$ is a rule that assigns to every element $a\in A$, an element $f(a) \in B$.
$f(a)$ is the image of $a$

A function $f$ can be injective (or one to one) iff
$$
f(x) = f(y) \implies x=y
$$

A function $f$ can be surjective (or onto) iff $$
\forall b \in B,\,  \exists a \in A \,\, s.t.\,f(a)=b
$$
The image of $f$ is $$
f(A) = \{f(a)\mid a\in A\}
$$
Fact:
$f:A\to{} B$ is surjective iff $f(A)=B$

A function $f$ can be bijective iff it is injective and surjective

How to prove something is surjective
Claim: $f:\mathbb{R}\to{} \mathbb{R}$ be given by $f(x)=2x+1$. Then $f$ is surjective

Proof: Let $y \in R$. We need to find $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=y$

Let $x=\frac{1}{2}(y-1)$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
f(x)&=2\left( \frac{1}{2}(y+1) \right) \\
&=y-1+1 \\
&=y
\end{align} \\
\implies  f\text{ is surjective} \square.
$$
let $f:A\to{} B,\, g:B\to{} C$. The composition $(g \circ f):A\to{} C$ is defined by $(g \circ f)(x)=g(f(x))$

Prop: Let $f:A\to{} B$ and $g:B\to{} c$ be functions. if f and g are both injective, then $g \circ f$ is injective.

Proof: assume $$
(g \circ f)(x)=(g \circ f)(y)
$$
We want to show that $x=y$
By definition:$$
g(f(x))=g(f(y))
$$
since $g$ is injective, $$
f(x)=f(y)
$$
since f is injective,$$
x=y
$$
so $g\circ f$ is injective$\square.$


Prop:
Let $f:A\to{} B$, $g:B\to{} C$ be functions
1. if $f$ and $g$ are both surjective, then so is $g \circ f$
2. if $f$ and $g$ are both bijective, then so is $g \circ f$

Proof:
1. Exercise
2. If $f$ and $g$ are both bijective, then they're both injective, meaning $g\circ f$ is injective, and they're both surjective, meaning $g \circ f$ is surjective. therefore $g \circ f$ is bijective $\square.$
