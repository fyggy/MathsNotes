### Theorem :
Let $A$ be a real ${} 2\times 2 {}$ matrix. Then exactly one of the following hold:
1. $A$ is diagonalisable over $\mathbb{R} {}$, that is, there exist ${} \lambda_{1},\, \lambda_{2} \in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that $A {}$ is similar to
$$
\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_{1} & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_{2} \end{pmatrix} 
$$
	This happens when $A {}$ has 2 distinct *real* eigenvalues
1. ${} A$ is not diagonalisable over $\mathbb{R}$, but ${} \exists \lambda \in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that ${} A {}$ is similar to 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}\lambda & 1 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{pmatrix} 
$$
	This happens when $A {}$ has a single real eigenvalue
1. ${} A$ is not diagonalisable over $\mathbb{R}$, but ${} \exists \alpha,\, \beta \in \mathbb{R} {}$, ${} \beta\neq 0 {}$, such that ${} A {}$ is similar to 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\ -\beta & \alpha \end{pmatrix} 
$$
	This happens when $A {}$ has 2 distinct eigenvalues ${} \lambda_{1}=\alpha+\beta i {}$ and ${} \lambda_{2} = \alpha - \beta i {}$
	(this is diagonalisable over ${} \mathbb{C}$)
