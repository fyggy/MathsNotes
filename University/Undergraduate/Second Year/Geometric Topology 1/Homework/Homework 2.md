1. 
i)
![[Pasted image 20241003225854.png]]
So the writhe ${} w(D)=3 {}$.
ii)
![[Pasted image 20241003231453.png]]
So the linking number is ${} \frac{6}{2}=3 {}$.

Then
$$
\begin{align}
c+d &=2a \\
a+c & =2b \\
b+e & =2c \\
a+e & =2d \\
b+d & =2e
\end{align}
$$
We may suppose that ${} e=0 {}$ and ${} d=1 {}$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
 b+1  & =0 \\
b & =-1 \\
a & =2  \\
-1 & =2c \\
2+c & =-2 \\
c & =-4 \\
-8 & =-1 \\
\Rightarrow n & =7
 \end{align}
$$

so
$$
\begin{align}
 a  & =2 \\
b & =6 \\
c & =5 \\
d & =1 \\
e & =0 
 \end{align}
$$
Therefore, the colouring number is $7$.
