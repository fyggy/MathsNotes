# Geometric Topology
## Topological Concepts
### Definition 1.1: Topological Space
A topological space consists of a set ${} X {}$ together with a distinguished collection ${} \mathcal{T} {}$ of open subsets of ${} X {}$ which are defined to be open. To be a topology, ${} \mathcal{T} {}$ must follow
- ${} \varnothing,\,X \in\mathcal{T} {}$
- ${} V,\,W \in \mathcal{T} \Rightarrow V \cap W \in \mathcal{ T} {}$
- ${} V_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{T} \Rightarrow \bigcup_{\alpha} V_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{T} {}$
We say that ${} A \subseteq X {}$ is closed iff ${} X-A {}$ is open. 

If ${} X= \mathbb{R}^{n} {}$ or a metric space, these notions coincide with the usual ones with ${} \varepsilon,\,\delta {}$
### Definition 1.2: Continuity
A map ${} f:X\to{}Y {}$ is *continuous* iff ${} W \subseteq Y {}$ is open in $Y {}$ implies that ${} f^{-1}(W) \subseteq X {}$ is open in ${} X {}$.
### Definition 1.3: Homeomorphisms
${} f:X\to{}Y {}$ a *homeomorphism* if $f {}$ is bijective, $f {}$ is continuous, and ${} f^{-1} {}$ is continuous.

The existence of such a map $f {}$ means that ${} X {}$ and $Y {}$ are essentially the same topological space.
#### Example
Consider ${} f:[0,\,2\pi) \to{} S^{1} {}$ defined by ${} f(t)=(\cos t, \sin t) {}$ (${} S^{1} {}$ is the circle in the x-y plane). It is clear that ${} f {}$ is continuous and is a bijection, but note that it's inverse ${} f^{-1} {}$ is not continuous. Therefore, $f {}$ is not a homeomorphism.
## New topological spaces from old
### Definition 2.1: Subspace Topology
Let ${} X {}$ be a topological space with topology ${} \mathcal{T} {}$, and let ${} S \subseteq X {}$. Now $S {}$ is a topological space under ${} \mathcal{U}=\{ S \cap T \mid T \in \mathcal{T} \} {}$.

A good example of this would be ${} S^{n} {}$.
### Definition 2.2: Quotient Topology
Let $X {}$ be a topological space under $\mathcal{T} {}$, and let $\sim {}$ be an equivalence relation on $X {}$. Let ${} Q=X / \sim {}$ be the set of equivalence classes. We have a natural map ${} q:X \to{}Q {}$ by ${} q(x)=\text{equivalence class containing }x {}$
#### Example
If ${} X=\mathbb{Z} {}$, and ${} a\sim b {}$ is ${} a\equiv b \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n) {}$, then 
$$
Q=\{ [0],\, [1],\,\dots,\,[n-1] \}
$$
where ${} [a]=\{ a+kn \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\} {}$.

Now $Q {}$ has a natural topology under
$$
\mathcal{U}=\{ V \subseteq  Q \mid q^{-1}(V) \in  \mathcal{T} \}
$$
#### Example
Let ${} X= [0,\,2\pi] {}$, and let ${} 0 \sim 2\pi {}$ so that ${} 2\pi \sim 0 {}$, then ${} X / \sim  {}$ is homoeomorphic to ${} S^{1} {}$
#### Example
Let ${} X=[0,\, 2\pi]^{2} {}$, and for all ${} s,\, t \in [0,\, 2\pi] {}$,  ${} (0, s)\sim (2\pi, s) {}$ and ${} (t,\,  0)\sim (t,\, 2\pi) {}$, with all other elements only equivalent to themselves. This defines $\sim {}$ on $X {}$, and
$$
y \in  X / \sim  \qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad |q^{-1}(y)|=1,\, 2,\, 4
$$
i.e. the equivalence classes only have magnitudes ${} 1,\, 2,\, 4 {}$. Now ${} Q = X /\sim  {}$ is homoeomorphic to a torus of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$.

# Knots
### Trefoil Knot
![[Pasted image 20240923171100.png]]
Alternate diagrams of the left trefoil knot L3 and R3. These are subtly different, as you'll note that the left knot has 3 sections touching the outside, whereas the right right has only 2. A more symmetrical diagram may look like
![[Pasted image 20240923171509.png]]
The above are both R3. Note that the 2 different trefoils in the first figure cannot be continuously transformed into each other. The trefoil is the simplest *undetanglable* knot. The simplest knot is ${} S^{1} {}$, the unknot. In fact, every knot is a continuous injective map from ${} S^{1} {}$ to ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Most notably, *every* knot is homeomorphic to ${} S^{1} {}$, so we are not interested in knots as a topological space.

The following 2 diagrams are both the unknot:

In a knot diagram, a crossing may only contain 2 lines, and there may be no cusps or tangents

### Definition 1.1: Knots
Let ${} S^{1}=\{ (\cos t,\, \sin t) \mid t \in \mathbb{R}\} \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$. A *knot* is the image of a continuous injective of the circle into space. 
$$
f:S^{1} \to{} \mathbb{R}^{3}
$$
We also assume that ${} K=f(S^{1}) {}$ can be surrounded by a small tube with $K {}$ at it's centre of some fixed radius which also does not intersect itself. (then $K {}$ is a "tame" knot, as opposed to "wild" knots).
