(Correction from last lecture) #todo watch it
If ${} A,\, B, \in \mathbb{Z}^{c,\, c} {}$, then $A \sim B {}$ means that $PAQ=B {}$ where ${} \det  P=1=\det  Q {}$, and 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 12 \end{pmatrix} \sim \begin{pmatrix}3 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \not \sim \begin{pmatrix}2 & 0 \\ 0 & 6 \end{pmatrix} 
$$
as ${} 2,\, 6 {}$ are not coprime. 
# 
## Kauffman Bracket 
It's a Laurent polynomial in $A$ that is generated by a link diagram, $D$, which is often written as
$$
\langle D \rangle =\framebox{D}=\operatorname{kb}(D)
$$
### Rules
Rules that determine the Kauffman bracket:
1. If $D=S_{1} {}$, then ${} \framebox{D}=1 {}$
2.
