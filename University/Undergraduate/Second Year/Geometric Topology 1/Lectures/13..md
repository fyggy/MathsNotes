# Surfaces with Boundary
## 
#### Example:

Note that letters may appear twice (not part of the boundary) *or* once (part of the boundary)
We often denote the boundary of a manifold $M$ as $\partial M {}$. In the mobius strip example:

### Proposition 1.1:
#todo find this
## Naked Edges
Two separate single edges inserted into ${} \partial P {}$ may become a single curve:


To obtain two circles, we must "insulate" edges with cuffs:

Now the characteristic of a torus is clearly
$$
\chi(T)=2-2g=2-2\cdot 1=0
$$
but for this new surface, we have
$$
\begin{align}
\chi(M) & =V-E+F \\
 & =3-6+1 \\
 & =-2
\end{align}
$$
Each cuff contributes ${} V-E+F=1-2+0=-1 {}$ to the Euler characteristic of the full surface. 

Let $r$ be the number of cuffs, or the number of boundary components (or unpaired letters). Each boundary is a compact $1 {}$-manifold. Therefore, it's either a circle, or a collection of (disjoint) circles in three dimensional space. This is exactly the definition of a link. 
## Final Classification
We have ${} M$ be a connected compact surface $M {}$ with boundary (possibly empty). (that is for all points ${} p \in M {}$, there exists some closed neighbourhood ${} U \ni p {}$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk ${} D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$)

If them we have a polygon $P$ with some boundary code $w$, then we can map from $P {}$ to some ${} M$, with $w$ a word such that each letter appears twice or once. 

If we have
$$
\partial M=\varnothing 
$$
then we have a normal form ${} \mathbb{A}_{g} {}$ or ${} \mathbb{C}_{h}$, and if ${} \partial M \neq \varnothing  {}$, then we add ${} \mathbb{D}_{r} {}$, where $r$ is the number of boundary components. 
### Theorem 1.2: Topological Type
Any connect compact surface $M$ with (possibly empty) boundary arises from a polygon $P$ and a single word $W$ of exactly 1 of the following types:
1) ${} \mathbb{A}_{0}=aa^{-1} {}$; ${} \mathbb{D}_{r}\; (r\geq 1) {}$; ${} \mathbb{A}_{g}\mathbb{D}_{r}\;(g\geq 1,\, r\geq 0) {}$
2) ${} \mathbb{C}_{h} \mathbb{D}_{r}\;(h\geq 1,\, r\geq 0) {}$
with Euler characteristic:
1) ${} \chi(\mathbb{A}_{g}\mathbb{D}_{r})=\chi(\mathbb{A}_{g})+\chi(\mathbb{D}_{r})=2-2g-r {}$
2) ${} \chi(\mathbb{C}_{h} \mathbb{D}_{r})=\chi(\mathbb{C}_{h})+\chi( \mathbb{D}_{r})=2-h-r {}$
where $g$ is the genus, $r$ is the number of boundary components, and $h$ is the number of crosscaps.

Then $M$ is determined up to homeomorphism by the following $3$ pieces of information:
1) Orientability (yes or no)
2) Euler Characteristic ${} \chi(M)$
3) $r {}$, being the number of boundary components. 
#### Example:
${} \chi(M)=5 {}$, ${} r=1 {}$, and the surface is orientable. Then ${} 2-2g=-4 {}$, and so ${} g=3 {}$. This is the surface:

#### Example:
We found earlier that ${} abda^{-1}eb^{-1} \sim (x^{-1}axa^{-1})(ed)=\mathbb{A}_{1}\mathbb{D}_{1} {}$

We also found that
$$
W=abdaeb \sim xxd^{-1}(beb^{-1})=\mathbb{C}_{1} \mathbb{D}_{2}
$$
### Lemma 1.3: Lemma A
Given ${} \mathbb{A}_{1}=aba^{-1}b^{-1} {}$, ${} W=u\mathbb{A}_{1}E {}$ where $E {}$ does not involve ${} a,\, b,\, u {}$ or their inverses. Then ${} W \sim \mathbb{A}_{1} uE {}$
#### Proof:
We have that
$$
\begin{align}
u\mathbb{A}_{1}E & =uaba^{-1}b^{-1}E &  & x=ua \\
 & \sim xbx^{-1}ub^{-1}E &  & y=xb \\
 & \sim yx^{-1}uy^{-1}xE &  & z=yx^{-1} \\
 & \sim zuy^{-1}z^{-1}y E &  & w=zuy^{-1} \\
 & \sim wz^{-1}w^{-1}zuE
\end{align}
$$
### Lemma 1.4: Lemma C
Given ${} \mathbb{C}_{1}=cc {}$, and let ${} W=u\mathbb{C}_{1}E {}$ where $E$ does not involve $c$ or $u$ or their inverses. Then ${} W \sim \mathbb{C}_{1}uE {}$.

These lemmas will help us to prove the classification theorem. If we have
$$
\begin{align}
 W & = \mathbb{A}_{g}d \\
 & \sim \mathbb{A}_{g}du^{-1}u \\
 & \sim u \mathbb{A}_{g }du^{-1} \\
 & \sim \mathbb{A}_{g} udu^{-1}=\mathbb{A}_{g} \mathbb{D}_{1} 
 \end{align}
$$
Likewise, 
$$
W=\mathbb{C}_{h}d \sim  \mathbb{C}_{h}udu^{-1}=\mathbb{C}_{h} \mathbb{D}_{1}
$$
and so a naked letter at the end may be turned into a cuff. 
## Connected Sums
Suppose we have two surfaces, say $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ like these two tori: ![[Pasted image 20241118174542.png]]
What if we wanted to do this in terms of polygons? Then We
