# Surfaces with Boundary
## 
#### Example:

Note that letters may appear twice (not part of the boundary) *or* once (part of the boundary)
We often denote the boundary of a manifold $M$ as $\partial M {}$. In the mobius strip example:

### Proposition 1.1:
#todo find this
## Naked Edges
Two separate single edges inserted into ${} \partial P {}$ may become a single curve:


To obtain two circles, we must "insulate" edges with cuffs:

Now the characteristic of a torus is clearly
$$
\chi(T)=2-2g=2-2\cdot 1=0
$$
but for this new surface, we have
$$
\begin{align}
\chi(M) & =V-E+F \\
 & =3-6+1 \\
 & =-2
\end{align}
$$
Each cuff contributes ${} V-E+F=1-2+0=-1 {}$ to the Euler characteristic of the full surface. 

Let $r$ be the number of cuffs, or the number of boundary components (or unpaired letters). Each boundary is a compact $1 {}$-manifold. Therefore, it's either a circle, or a collection of (disjoint) circles in three dimensional space. This is exactly the definition of a link. 
## Final Classification
We have ${} M$ be a connected compact surface $M {}$ with boundary (possibly empty). (that is for all points ${} p \in M {}$, there exists some closed neighbourhood ${} U \ni p {}$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk ${} D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$)

If them we have a polygon $P$ with some boundary code $w$, then we can map from $P {}$ to some ${} M$, with $w$ a word such that each letter appears twice or once. 

If we have
$$
\partial M=\varnothing 
$$
then we have a normal form ${} \mathbb{A}_{g} {}$ or ${} \mathbb{C}_{h}$, and if ${} \partial M \neq \varnothing  {}$, then we add ${} \mathbb{D}_{r} {}$, where $r$ is the number of boundary components.
