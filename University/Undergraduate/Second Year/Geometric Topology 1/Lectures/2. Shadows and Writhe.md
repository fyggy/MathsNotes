### Summary of last lecture
A *knot* ${} K {}$ is a loop in space, or a continuous injective map from ${} S^{1}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} K \approx S^{1} {}$ for all knots
Two knots ${} K, L {}$ are equivalent via ambient isotopy, that is, if there is a orientation preserving homeomorphism ${} F:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$ such that ${} F(K)=L {}$.
A knot diagram converts a knot in space to a diagram on the plane by projecting $K {}$ onto some plane in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$, which preservers information about crossings, and all contact between strands is *transverse*, that is, there are no triple points, cusps, or tangent crossings. 
# Knots
## Shadow
### Definition 1.1: Shadow of a knot diagram
The shadow of a knot diagram is generated by taking a valid knot diagram and replacing the crossings by vertices of a graph, yielding a graph with edges between where the crossings once were

#todo (clean up)
We may add crossings to a shadow to create a knot diagram

A shadow with $c {}$ vertices determines ${} 2^{c} {}$ knot diagrams. Exactly 2 of these diagrams will be *alternating* knot diagrams, that is, every overpass is followed by an underpass. If a knot has an alternating knot diagram, then the knot itself is called alternating. Interestingly, most knots do *not* have an alternating diagram. 

Any shadow may be made into the unknot by traveling along the line in one direction and always choosing a underpass when possible.

If two diagrams ${} D,\, D' {}$ determine equivalent knots, then the diagrams ${} D,\, D' {}$ are called isotopic, written ${} D \sim  D' {}$.
### Theorem 1.2: (Reidemeister)
This occurs iff ${} D,\, D' {}$ are related by a sequence of Reidemeister moves (to be defined later #todo fill in reference)
### Definition 1.3: Writhe
Let $D {}$ be a diagram of a knot $K {}$. The writhe depends on the diagram, not the knot. First, we orient $D {}$ (or ${} K {}$) by choosing a direction of travel.

(${} R3 {}$, oriented)
Then each crossing $c {}$ acquires a sign and an integer ${} w_{c} \in \{ -1,\, 1 \} {}$ defined as follows: rotate the overpass such that it is facing right. Then, if the underpass is facing up, then ${} w=1 {}$, and if the underpass is facing down, then ${} w=-1 {}$.

Then the writhe of the diagram $D {}$ is $W(D) {}$ is the sum ${} \sum_{\text{ all }c\text{ crossings}}w_{c} {}$, that is, the sum of all ${} w_{c} {}$. Therefore, the writhe of the above diagram is ${} +3 {}$. Note that ${} W(D) {}$ does depend on $D {}$. It is however independent of the orientation, as if the orientation is reversed, then note that both arrows above are reversed and the writhe ends up the same.
