# Paths and Loops
## Topological Spaces
#### Example:
${} \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the usual topology is a topological space, as is ${} \mathbb{C}^{n}$. 
${} S^{n}$ with the subspace topology in ${} \mathbb{R}^{n+1} {}$ is a topological space. We define
$$
S^{n}=\{ v \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid  \lVert v \rVert =1 \}
$$
Note that if ${} x \in S^{n} {}$, then ${} S^{n} \setminus \{ x \} \cong \mathbb{R}^{n} {}$. 
#### Example:
We define
$$
T^{n}=S^{1} \times{\dots}\times S^{1}
$$
And we may consider ${} T^{n}\cong \mathbb{R}^{n} / \mathbb{Z}^{n} {}$.
#### Example:
Let $G$ be a graph in ${} \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ or ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Then $G {}$ is a topological space as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$
#### Example:
${} M$ is a surface. Then $M$ is a topological space.
#### Example: 
Quotients of polygons, like one with a edge code $xxx {}$.
#### Example:
A knot complement: if $K$ is a knot in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3}$, then the knot complement is ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} \setminus K {}$. 
## Paths
Define ${} \mathbb{I}=[0,\, 1] {}$. 
### Definition 1.1: Paths
If ${} X {}$ is a topological space, and ${} x_{0},\, x_{1} \in X {}$, then a path from ${} x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is a continuous map ${} \alpha:\mathbb{I} \to{}X {}$ with ${} \alpha(0)=x_{0} {}$ and ${} \alpha(1)=x_{1} {}$. 
### Definition 1.2: Loops
A loop based at ${} x_{0} \in X {}$ is a path from $x_{0}$ to $x_{0}$.
