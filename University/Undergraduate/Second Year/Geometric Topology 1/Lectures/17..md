# Paths and Loops
## Topological Spaces
#### Example:
${} \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the usual topology is a topological space, as is ${} \mathbb{C}^{n}$. 
${} S^{n}$ with the subspace topology in ${} \mathbb{R}^{n+1} {}$ is a topological space. We define
$$
S^{n}=\{ v \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \mid  \lVert v \rVert =1 \}
$$
Note that if ${} x \in S^{n} {}$, then ${} S^{n} \setminus \{ x \} \cong \mathbb{R}^{n} {}$. 
#### Example:
We define
$$
T^{n}=S^{1} \times{\dots}\times S^{1}
$$
And we may consider ${} T^{n}\cong \mathbb{R}^{n} / \mathbb{Z}^{n} {}$.
#### Example:
Let $G$ be a graph in ${} \mathbb{R}^{2} {}$ or ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Then $G {}$ is a topological space as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{2} {}$
#### Example:
${} M$ is a surface. Then $M$ is a topological space.
#### Example: 
Quotients of polygons, like one with a edge code $xxx {}$.
#### Example:
A knot complement: if $K$ is a knot in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3}$, then the knot complement is ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} \setminus K {}$. 
## Paths
Define ${} \mathbb{I}=[0,\, 1] {}$. 
### Definition 1.1: Paths
If ${} X {}$ is a topological space, and ${} x_{0},\, x_{1} \in X {}$, then a path from ${} x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$ is a continuous map ${} \alpha:\mathbb{I} \to{}X {}$ with ${} \alpha(0)=x_{0} {}$ and ${} \alpha(1)=x_{1} {}$. 
### Definition 1.2: Loops
A loop based at ${} x_{0} \in X {}$ is a path from $x_{0}$ to $x_{0}$. 
#### Example:
The constant loop ${} \varepsilon_{x_{0}}$ based at $x_{0}$ is given by ${} \varepsilon_{x_{0}}(s)=x_{0} {}$.
### Definition 1.3: Path Connectivity
A space $X$ is *path-connected* if for any ${} x_{0},\, x_{1} {}$, there exists a path $\alpha$ starting at $x_{0}$ and ending at $x_{1}$. We have that $X$ is path connected implies that $X$ is connected. 
### Definition 1.4: Path Concatenation
Let $\alpha$ be a path from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1} {}$, and let $\beta$ be a path from $x_{1}$ to $x_{2}$. Then the concatenation of $\alpha$ with $\beta$, denoted by $\alpha\beta$, is a path from $x_{0}$ to $x_{2}$, defined by
$$
\alpha\beta(s)=\begin{cases}
\alpha(2s) &  & 0\leq s\leq \frac{1}{2} \\
\beta(2s) &  & \frac{1}{2} \leq  s \leq  1
\end{cases}
$$
We have that
$$
(\alpha \beta)\gamma\neq \alpha(\beta\gamma)
$$
However, both are paths from $x_{0}$ to $x_{3}$. 
### Definition 1.5: Path Reversal
Let $\alpha$ be a path from $x_{0} {}$ to $x_{1}$. Then define the reversal ${} \alpha ^{-1}(s)=\alpha(1-s) {}$, and this is a path from $x_{1}$ to $x_{0} {}$. 
## Path Homotopy
### Definition 1.6: Path Homotopy
Given two paths ${} \alpha,\, \beta {}$ from ${} x_{0} {}$ to ${} x_{1} {}$, we say that they are *path-homotopic* if there exists a continuous map ${} H:\mathbb{I}^{2} \to{}X {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
H(s,\, 0) & =\alpha(s) \\
H(s,\, 1) & =\beta(s) \\
H(0,\, t) & =x_{0}  \\
H(1,\, t) & =x_{1} 
\end{align}
$$
Then $H {}$ is called a path-homotopy from $\alpha {}$ to $\beta$, and we write ${} \alpha \simeq \beta {}$. Furthermore, $H_{t}(s)$ are continuous for all $t$. 
### Lemma 1.7: Path Homotopy is an Equivalence
Path-homotopy is an *equivalence relation* on the set of paths from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$. 
#### Proof:
1) Reflexivity:
Let ${} F(s,\, t)=\alpha(s) {}$ for all ${} t \in \mathbb{I} {}$. This is therefore continuous, and so ${} \alpha \simeq \alpha {}$
2) Symmetry:
Suppose that $\alpha \simeq \beta {}$. Then we have a path homotopy ${} F(s,\, t) {}$. Now define ${} G(s,\, t)=F(s,\, 1-t) {}$. This is still continuous, as ${} 1-t {}$ is continuous, and gives us that $\beta \simeq \alpha {}$.
3) Transitivity:
Suppose that ${} \alpha \simeq \beta {}$ by $F$ and $\beta \simeq \gamma {}$ by $G$. Then define
$$
H(s,\, t)=\begin{cases}
F(s,\, 2t) &  & 0\leq t\leq \frac{1}{2} \\
G(s,\, 2t) &  & \frac{1}{2}\leq t\leq 1
\end{cases}
$$
Now $H$ is still continuous, by the piecewise definition. Therefore, $\alpha \simeq \gamma {}$. 

Therefore, $\simeq$ is a equivalence relation.

Now if $\alpha$ is a path from $x_{0}$ to $x_{1}$, then it's equivalence class is denoted ${} [\alpha]$.
