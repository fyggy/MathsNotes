# Mirror Images, Links and Reversal
## Mirror Images
### Definition 1.1: Mirror Images
Let ${} m:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$ denote some reflection in some plane in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Then the *mirror image* of a knot $K$, denoted ${} mK=m(K) {}$ is well defined up to ambient isotopy, i.e. it doesn't matter what plane is chosen

For if ${} m_{1},\, m_{2} {}$ are reflections, then ${} m_{1} m_{2}K {}$ is a rotation of $K {}$, which is clearly ambient isotopic (AI) to ${} K {}$. Therefore, ${} m_{1} ^{2}=\id  {}$, so ${} m_{1} m_{1} m_{2} K=m_{2} K\approx m 1K {}$
### Lemma 1.2: 
If $D$ is a diagram for $K$, then the shadow of $D$ with all crossings reversed is a valid diagram for $mK$. 
#### Proof:
Take the plane to be the plane on which $D$ lies. Then underpasses are switched for overpasses, and this is a mirror of $D {}$. 
#### Note:

We may however reflect in any plane, like so. Note that these 2 knots are not AI, and in general this is true for most knots. If a knot ${} K \approx mK {}$, then $K$ is said to be *achiral*, such as the figure 8 knot:

## Links
### Definition 1.3: Links
A *link* is a disjoint union of $1$ or more knots in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Note that every knot is a link
#### Example: Hopf Link
The Hopf link, $H$, is

Clearly this is equivalent to it's mirror image.
The Hopf link has 2 distinct orientations:
![[Pasted image 20241003144003.png]]
The writhe of the first is positive, and the second is negative. Therefore, the first is the right orientation and the second is the left orientation, as negative writhe generally corresponds to being a *left hand* knot. 
#### Example:
These are the Borromean rings.

The linking number, which is half the writhes of the crossings between 2 separate linked segments, is $0$ in this situation.
