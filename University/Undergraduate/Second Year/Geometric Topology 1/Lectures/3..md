# Mirror Images and Reversal
## 
### Definition 1.1: Mirror Images
Let ${} m:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$ denote some reflection in some plane in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Then the *mirror image* of a knot $K$, denoted ${} mK=m(K) {}$ is well defined up to ambient isotopy, i.e. it doesn't matter what plane is chosen

For if ${} m_{1},\, m_{2} {}$ are reflections, then ${} m_{1} m_{2}K {}$ is a rotation of $K {}$, which is clearly ambient isotopic (AI) to ${} K {}$. Therefore, ${} m_{1} ^{2}=\id  {}$, so ${} m_{1} m_{1} m_{2} K=m_{2} K\approx m 1K {}$
### Lemma 1.2: 
If $D$ is a diagram for $K$, then the shadow of $D$ with all crossings reversed is a valid diagram for $mK$. 
#### Proof:
Take the plane to be the plane on which $D$ lies. Then underpasses are switched for overpasses, and this is a mirror of $D$. 
#### Note:

We may however reflect in any plane, like so. Note that these 2 knots are not AI, and in general this is true for most knots. If a knot ${} K \approx mK {}$, then $K$ is said to be *achiral*, such as the figure 8 knot:
