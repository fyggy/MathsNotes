### 
Let $L$ be a knot (or link). Represent $L$ by a diagram $D$ with $c$ crossings, and $c$ arcs (this only fails when you have a closed arc, and may be simply fixed by an R2 move), and get a matrix
$$
A_{+} \in \mathbb{Z}^{c,\, c}
$$
We then modify $A_{+}$ using chess signs to make a zero sum matrix. Now
### Proposition 1.1:
If we delete any row and any column of ${} A_{+} {}$ to get $A$ and set ${} \Delta=|\det  A| {}$, then $\Delta$ does not depend on the choice of which row and column is being deleted. 
#### Note:
By construction, ${} \det  A_{+}=0 {}$
### Lemma 1.2: Smith Normal Form
Let ${} A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m,\, m} {}$. Then there exist ${} P,\, Q \in \mathbb{Z}^{m,\, m} {}$ with ${} \det  P=\det  Q=1 {}$ such that
$$
PAQ= \begin{pmatrix}
d_{1} & 0 & \dots  & 0 \\
0 & d_{2}  & \dots  & 0 \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots  & \vdots  \\
0 & 0 & \dots  & d_{m}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
### Theorem 1.3: Colouring Theorem
 A link ${} L$ is $n$-colourable iff ${} \gcd(n,\, \Delta)>1 {}$. In particular, $L$ is ${} n {}$-colourable for all $n {}$ iff ${} \Delta=0 {}$ (this is impossible for a knot, as no knot is $2 {}$-colourable). On the other hand, $L$ is $n$-colourable for no $n\geq 2$ iff ${} \Delta=1 {}$. This is the case for the unknot.
#### Proof:
