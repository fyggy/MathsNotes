# Colouring

### 
Let $L$ be a knot (or link). Represent $L$ by a diagram $D$ with $c$ crossings, and $c$ arcs (this only fails when you have a closed arc, and may be simply fixed by an R2 move), and get a matrix
$$
A_{+} \in \mathbb{Z}^{c,\, c}
$$
We then modify $A_{+}$ using chess signs to make a zero sum matrix. Now
### Proposition 1.1:
If we delete any row and any column of ${} A_{+} {}$ to get $A$ and set ${} \Delta=|\det  A| {}$, then $\Delta$ does not depend on the choice of which row and column is being deleted. 
#### Note:
By construction, ${} \det  A_{+}=0 {}$
### Theorem 1.1: Colouring Theorem
 A link $L$ is $n$-colourable iff ${} \gcd(n,\, \Delta)>1 {}$. In particular, $L$ is ${} n {}$-colourable for all $n {}$ iff ${} \Delta=0 {}$ (this is impossible for a knot, as no knot is $2$-colourable). 

 On the other hand, $L$ is $n$-colourable for no $n\geq 2$ iff ${} \Delta=1 {}$.
