## Mirror Images
### Definition 1.1: Mirror Images
Let ${} m:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$ denote some reflection in some plane in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Then the *mirror image* of a knot $K$, denoted ${} mK=m(K) {}$ is well defined up to ambient isotopy, i.e. it doesn't matter what plane is chosen

For if ${} m_{1},\, m_{2} {}$ are reflections, then ${} m_{1} m_{2}K {}$ is a rotation of $K {}$, which is clearly ambient isotopic (AI) to ${} K {}$. Therefore, ${} m_{1} ^{2}=\id  {}$, so ${} m_{1} m_{1} m_{2} K=m_{2} K\approx m 1K {}$
### Lemma 1.2: 
If $D$ is a diagram for $K$, then the shadow of $D$ with all crossings reversed is a valid diagram for $mK$. 
#### Proof:
Take the plane to be the plane on which $D$ lies. Then underpasses are switched for overpasses, and this is a mirror of $D {}$. 
#### Note:

We may however reflect in any plane, like so. Note that these 2 knots are not AI, and in general this is true for most knots. If a knot ${} K \approx mK {}$, then $K$ is said to be *achiral*, such as the figure 8 knot:

## Links
### Definition 1.3: Links
A *link* is a disjoint union of $1$ or more knots in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Note that every knot is a link
#### Example: Hopf Link
The Hopf link, $H {}$, is
![[Pasted image 20241003143558.png]]
Clearly this is equivalent to it's mirror image.
The Hopf link has 2 distinct orientations:
![[Pasted image 20241003144003.png]]
The writhe of the first is positive, and the second is negative. Therefore, the first is the right orientation and the second is the left orientation, as negative writhe generally corresponds to being a *left hand* knot. 
#### Example:
These are the Borromean rings.
![[Pasted image 20241003144411.png]]
The linking number (see below) is $0 {}$ between any 2 components
### Definition 1.4: Linking Number:
Let ${} K_{1},\, K_{2} {}$ be 2 linked knots. Then the linking number is
$$
\ell(K_{1},\, K_{2})=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\substack{c \in \{\text{set of crossings} \\ \text{ between }K_{1} \text{ with }K_{2} \}} }w(c)
$$
We'll see that if $K_{1}$ and $K_{2} {}$ can be separated in space, then ${} \ell(K_{1},\, K_{2})=0 {}$. The converse is not always true however. Consider the Whitehead link:
![[Pasted image 20241003185143.png]]
This has linking number $0 {}$, but the two links cannot be separated
# Reidemeister Moves
## Introduction
The Reidemeister moves are of enormous theoretical value for proving theorems and finding invariants, but are of limited *practical* value (apparently). 
### Definition 2.1: Reidemeister Moves
The moves come from situations which are prohibited from knot diagrams: the cusp, the tangent, and the triple point:
![[Pasted image 20241003185547.png|100]]
The Reidemeister moves let us "get past" these forbidden positions, like so:
![[Pasted image 20241003190253.png|600]]
### Definition 2.2:
Suppose a link diagram ${} D' {}$ is obtained from a diagram $D {}$ by applying Reidemeister moves (e.g. ${} R 1,\, R2,\, R 1,\, R_{3},\, R3,\, \dots {}$). Then we say that ${} D,\, D' {}$ are isotopic. Note that this is distinct from ambient isotopy. We write ${} D \sim D' {}$ iff they are isotopic. 

It is clear that $D \sim D' \Rightarrow {}$the links ${} K,\, K' {}$ that are represented by ${} D,\, D' {}$ are ambient isotopic. This is not proven but is clear from physical intuition. 
### Theorem 2.3: Reidemeister's Theorem
If ${} K,\, K' {}$ are AI (in space), then any diagrams ${} D,\, D' {}$ that represent them are isotopic, that is, there exists some succession of R-moves from ${} D\to{}D' {}$ (and vice versa)
#### Note:
Deformation of diagrams in the plane are always allowed and do not affect the nature of the crossings, and are called by some an "R0 move"
#### Examples:
![[Pasted image 20241003191841.png]]
Note that the writhe at the start is $-1 {}$, the middle is $-1 {}$, and the end is $0$. This is because the only R-move that affects the writhe is R1, and it reduces or increases it by 1, depending on the orientation of the twist

![[Pasted image 20241003193308.png]]
This is another example involving R3 and R1.
![[Pasted image 20241003194150.png]]
This a limitation of R-moves: see that this is trivially $R_{3} {}$, but it would take far too many Reidemeister moves to show that.
## Effect of R-moves on writhe of diagram
### Lemma 2.4:
Moves R2, R3, do not change the writhe of the diagram. 
#### Proof:
R2:
![[Pasted image 20241003194536.png|400]]
The writhe is unchanged
![[Pasted image 20241003194756.png]]
Again the writhe is unchanged. The same goes for the mirror of both of these, and it does not depend on the orientation of any of the strands
### Definition 2.5: Regular Isotopy
If ${} D' {}$ can be obtained from ${} D {}$ only using R2 and R3 moves, then we say that ${} D,\, D' {}$ are *regularly isotopic*, and write (confusingly)
$$
D \approx D'
$$
The lemma says that ${} D \approx D' \Rightarrow w(D)=w(D') {}$. 

It turns out the following diagram $D$ with writhe $0$ is regularly isotopic to ${} S^{1}$ the circle:
