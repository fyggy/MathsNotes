### 
Note that any property that does not vary by all R-moves is called a *knot invariant*, that is, it depends only on the link up to ambient isotopy. A good example is knot colourability.
#### Examples:
We got last lecture that ${} 6_3 {}$ is $13 {}$-colourable. In fact, it is $n$-colourable iff ${} 13 \mid n {}$. 
${} 3_{1}$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff ${} 3 \mid n {}$. 
The unknot is not $n {}$-colourable for any $n {}$. 
${} 2 {}$ separated circles are colourable mod ${} n {}$ for all $n\geq 2 {}$.
#### Note: 
A knot ${} K$ is $n$-colourable iff $mK$ is.

### Theorem 1.1: Colourability is a knot invariant
Let $K$ be $n$-colourable. Then any diagram isotopic to $K$ is ${} n {}$-colourable
#### Proof:
We show that colourability is invariant under R-moves:
R3:

and so ${} 2a=e+f=b+c {}$ and ${} 2f=c+d {}$ on the left, and ${} 2a=e+f$, ${} 2e=b+x {}$ and ${} 2a=x+d {}$ on the right.

From the left, we get that ${} 2a-2f=b-d {}$, and from the right, if the equations work, then ${} 2e-b=2a-d {}$, and so ${} b-d=2e-2a {}$, so ${} 2e-2a=2a-2f {}$, and ${} 4a=2(e+f) {}$, which is true. Therefore, ${} x$ is determined (check, #todo)
## Matrices and Determinant
### Introduction
Let $D$ represent $4_1$:
![[Pasted image 20241007163915.png|400]]
The "augmented" colouring matrix is $A_{+}$:
$$
A_{+}=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Where each row corresponds to the ${} n^{\text{th}} {}$ crossing, each column corresponds to the (lexicographically sorted) strand, and put a ${} 2 {}$ if the strand is an overpass, or a $-1 {}$ if the strand is an underpass.
Then ${} D$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff 
$$
A_{+} \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \\ x_{4} \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n) 
$$
and not all ${} x_{i}$ are the same. 
#### Note:
The entries in each row sum to $0$. In this case, the entries in each column sum to $0$ too, since $D$ is alternating. We say then that $A_{+}$ is a *zero-sum* matrix.
### Proposition 1.2:
If ${} A_{+} \in \mathbb{Z}^{c,\, c} {}$ is a zero-sum matrix, then all it's first minors (determinants of it's ${} (c-1)(c-1) {}$ submatrices) are all equal up to a sign. 
#### Proof: 
In the notes #todo 

The "reduced" colouring matrix obtained by deleting the last row and column is 
$$
A=\begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} 
$$
This matrix has ${} \det  A=5 {}$. Let ${} \Delta=|\det  A| {}$. This is the *knot determinant* of $D {}$

We shall see that (more generally) we can define ${} A {}$ and $\Delta$. Then $L$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff ${} \gcd(n,\, \Delta)>1 {}$. 

To solve ${} A_{+} \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$, then
$$
A \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \end{pmatrix} =n \begin{pmatrix} b_{1} \\ b_{2} \\ b_{3} \end{pmatrix} 
$$
#### Note: 
Since $A_{+} {}$ is never invertible, we only need to consider equations coming from any ${} c-1 {}$ crossings
## Chess-Boarding
### Lemma 1.3: Chess Lemma
Let ${} D$ with $c {}$ crossings be a connected diagram of a link with no closed arc, that is, a knot which is disconnected from all other knots. Then the shadow has ${} c+2 {}$ regions (including the outside).

Now one may assign black and white to each region of the shadow such that the same colours only meet at crossings. 
![[Pasted image 20241007171807.png]]
#### Proof:
Not given, but relies on the fact that all vertices have degree 4.

Each crossing in $D$ now acquires a chess sign, ${} +1,\, -1 {}$, by this rule:
![[Pasted image 20241007172424.png]]
Note that this depends on the colouration, but there are only 2 possibilities, and they depend on the outside colouration. 

Note that if ${} D {}$ is alternating, then all the signs are equal. 
### Goeritz Method:
For alternating diagrams: Focus on the interior white regions, with white on the outside. Now we write a reduced matrix, according to a rule as follows: For each white region, negate the sum of crossings surrounding it, and put it on the diagonal. Then the off diagonal entries are the sum of the common crossings of each region. For example, in this knot, :
![[Pasted image 20241007173046.png]]
The Goeritz matrix is
$$
G= \begin{pmatrix}-3 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & -2 \end{pmatrix} 
$$
and then ${} \Delta=|\det  A|=|\det  G|=7 {}$. 
#### Example:
Let $D$ be the diagram:
![[Pasted image 20241007173531.png]]
Then 
$$
G=\begin{pmatrix}-1 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} 
$$
and so ${} \Delta=|\det  G|=3 {}$.

Chess boarding also is good for
1. Let ${} A_{+}$ be the augmented colouring matrix of some diagram $D$ (not necessarily alternating). Chessboard $D$. Change the sign of a row of $A_{+} {}$ iff the corresponding crossing has negative chess sign ${} -1 {}$. Then, the modified ${} A_{+} {}$, ${} A_{-} {}$, becomes a zero-sum matrix. So we can use the proposition to delete any row and any column (e.g. the last of both) to get the reduced matrix $A {}$ and compute the determinant, and get a well defined value ${} \Delta=|\det  A| {}$. This is the link determinant. (this works irrespective of the sign of the chessboard pattern)
2. Computing the determinant using regions and the Goeritz method. 
3. Understanding why any shadow of a diagram determines an alternating diagram (actually 2 mirror images)
4. Enables one to define the DT code of a diagram: (by convention) Orient the diagram such that the first crossing encountered is an underpass:
![[Pasted image 20241007175421.png]]
Label each crossing as one arrives in order. Chessboarding of the diagram implies that each crossing has 2 numbers, an odd and an even one. Arrange the numbers like so:![[Pasted image 20241007175646.png]]
We negate $2$ since $5 {}$ corresponds to the overpass not the underpass. Then, the DT-code is ${} 6\;8\;-2\;4 {}$.
