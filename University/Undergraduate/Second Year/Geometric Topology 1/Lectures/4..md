We may take ${} f=0 {}$, ${} e=1 {}$. Then:
$$
\begin{align}
b+c & =2a \\
  a+d& =2b \\
  b+e& =2c \\
 c+f & =2d \\
 d+f & =2e \\
 e+a & =2f
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
a & =12 \\
 b & =7 \\
 c & =4 \\
 d & =2 \\
  e & =1 \\
 f & =0
\end{align}
$$
#todo check this
and so since ${} 12+1=0 {}$, then this works ${} \mathrm{mod}\  13  {}$ 
### Definition 1.1: Colouring Number
A diagram ${} D {}$ is ${} n {}$-colourable if we can assign at least 2 distinct values from ${} \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that the crossing equations hold at every crossing.
#### Remark:
If ${} (x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{c}) {}$ is a solution to the colouring equations, then so is
$$
(x_{1}+k,\,\dots,\,x_{c}+k)
$$
and
$$
(kx_{1},\,\dots,\,kx_{c})
$$

To find a solution, we may always take $n$ as prime, as there always exists some $k$ such that ${} kx_{i}=1\:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$. 

In this particular example, all solutions of the colouring equations arise from the above remark:
$$
\begin{align}
(-1,\, 7,\, 4,\, 2,\, 1,0) \\
 (0,\, 8,\, 5,\, 3,\, 2,\, 1) \\
 (-3,\, 8,\, -1,\, 6,\, 3,\, 0)
\end{align}
$$
And so we have at most ${} 13^{2} {}$ solutions.
Note that the colouring number corresponds to how many colours are required to colour *any* isotopic diagram of a knot.
### Facts:
1) If a knot is ${} n$-colourable, then it is ${} nk {}$-colourable. #todo exercise
2) No *knot* is $2$-colourable, so the colouring number of any knot must be odd. 
Suppose that ${} n=2 {}$, so ${} a+b=2c=0 {}$, and so ${} a=b\:(\mathrm{mod}\  2)  {}$, and so all the colours are the same, which isn't allowed. 
3) Any link with at least 2 components is ${} 2$-colourable (so $2k {}$-colourable). Note that the following link is $2$-colourable:

4) Big Theorem (colorllary of Reidemeister's theorem)
Colourability ${} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$ depends only on isotopy class of a diagram ${} D {}$ (and so is invariant by R-moves). Thus it's a property of associated link (invariant by ambient isotopy)
5) The unknot cannot be coloured for *any* modulus ${} n$.
