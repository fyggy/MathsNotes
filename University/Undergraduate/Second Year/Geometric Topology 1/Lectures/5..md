Note that any property that does not vary by all R-moves is called a *knot invariant*, that is, it depends only on the link up to ambient isotopy. A good example is knot colourability.
#### Examples:
We got last lecture that ${} 6_3 {}$ is $13 {}$-colourable. In fact, it is $n$-colourable iff ${} 13 \mid n {}$. 
${} 3_{1}$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff ${} 3 \mid n {}$. 
The unknot is not $n {}$-colourable for any $n {}$. 
${} 2 {}$ separated circles are colourable mod ${} n {}$ for all $n\geq 2 {}$.
#### Note: 
A knot ${} K$ is $n$-colourable iff $mK$ is.

### Theorem 1.1: Colourability is a knot invariant
Let $K$ be $n$-colourable. Then any diagram isotopic to $K$ is ${} n {}$-colourable
#### Proof:
We show that colourability is invariant under R-moves:
R3:

and so ${} 2a=e+f=b+c {}$ and ${} 2f=c+d {}$ on the left, and ${} 2a=e+f$, ${} 2e=b+x {}$ and ${} 2a=x+d {}$ on the right.

From the left, we get that ${} 2a-2f=b-d {}$, and from the right, if the equations work, then ${} 2e-b=2a-d {}$, and so ${} b-d=2e-2a {}$, so ${} 2e-2a=2a-2f {}$, and ${} 4a=2(e+f) {}$, which is true. Therefore, ${} x$ is determined (check, #todo)
## Matrices and Determinant
### Introduction
Let $D$ represent $4_1$:
![[Pasted image 20241007163915.png|400]]
The "augmented" colouring matrix is $A_{+}$:
$$
A_{+}=
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & -1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Where each row corresponds to the ${} n^{\text{th}} {}$ crossing, each column corresponds to the (lexicographically sorted) strand, and put a ${} 2 {}$ if the strand is an overpass, or a $-1 {}$ if the strand is an underpass.
Then ${} D$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff 
$$
A_{+} \begin{pmatrix} x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \\ x_{4} \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n) 
$$
and not all ${} x_{i}$ are the same. 
#### Note:
The entries in each row sum to $0$. In this case, the entries in each column sum to $0$ too, since $D$ is alternating. We say then that $A_{+}$ is a *zero-sum* matrix.
### Proposition 1.2:
If ${} A_{+} \in \mathbb{Z}^{c,\, c} {}$ is a zero-sum matrix, then all it's first minors (determinants of it's ${} (c-1)(c-1) {}$ submatrices) are all equal up to a sign. 
#### Proof: 
In the notes #todo 

The "reduced" colouring matrix obtained by deleting the last row and column is 
$$
A=\begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} 
$$
This matrix has ${} \det  A=5 {}$. Let ${} \Delta=|\det  A| {}$. This is the *knot determinant* of $D {}$

We shall see that (more generally) we can define ${} A {}$ and it's deter
