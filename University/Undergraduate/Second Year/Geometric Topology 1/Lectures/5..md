### 
Note that any property that does not vary by all R-moves is called a *knot invariant*, that is, it depends only on the link up to ambient isotopy. A good example is knot colourability.
#### Examples:
We got last lecture that ${} 6_3 {}$ is $13 {}$-colourable. In fact, it is $n$-colourable iff ${} 13 \mid n {}$. 
${} 3_{1}$ is ${} n {}$-colourable iff ${} 3 \mid n {}$. 
The unknot is not $n {}$-colourable for any $n {}$. 
${} 2 {}$ separated circles are colourable mod ${} n {}$ for all $n\geq 2 {}$.
#### Note: 
A knot ${} K$ is $n$-colourable iff $mK$ is.

### Theorem 1.1: Colourability is a knot invariant
Let $K$ be $n$-colourable. Then any diagram isotopic to $K$ is ${} n {}$-colourable
#### Proof:
We show that colourability is invariant under R-moves:
R3:

and so ${} 2a=e+f=b+c {}$ and ${} 2f=c+d {}$ on the left, and ${} 2a=e+f$, ${} 2e=b+x {}$ and ${} 2a=x+d {}$ on the right.

From the left, we get that ${} 2a-2f=b-d {}$, and from the right, if the equations work, then ${} 2e-b=2a-d {}$, and so ${} b-d=2e-2a {}$, so ${} 2e-2a=2a-2f {}$, and ${} 4a=2(e+f) {}$, which is true. Therefore, ${} x$ is determined (check, #todo)
