### Summary of last lecture
A *knot* ${} K {}$ is a loop in space, or a continuous injective map from ${} S^{1}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} K \approx S^{1} {}$ for all knots
Two knots ${} K, L {}$ are equivalent via ambient isotopy, that is, if there is a orientation preserving homeomorphism ${} F:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to{}\mathbb{R}^{3} {}$ such that ${} F(K)=L {}$.
A knot diagram converts a knot in space to a diagram on the plane by projecting $K {}$ onto some plane in ${} \mathbb{R}^{3} {}$, which preservers information about crossings, and all contact between strands is *transverse*, that is, there are no triple points, cusps, or tangent crossings. 
# Knots
## Shadow
### Definition 1.1: Shadow of a knot diagram
The shadow of a knot diagram is generated by taking a valid knot diagram and replacing the crossings by vertices of a graph, yielding a graph with edges between where the crossings once were
