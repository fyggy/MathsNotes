### Definition 1.1: Ordinary Points
If ${} P(x_{0})\neq 0$, then $x_{0}$ is called an *ordinary point*. If ${} P(x_{0})=0 {}$ (and either ${} Q(x_{0}) {}$ or ${} R(x_{0})\neq 0$) then $x_{0}$ is a singular point
#### Example:
${} y''-xy=0 {}$. Note that $x_{0}=0 {}$ is an ordinary point.
### Theorem 1.2: 
Suppose that $x_{0} {}$ is an ordinary point of ${} P(x)y''+Q(x)y'+R(x)y=0 {}$. Then it has two linearly independent analytic solutions of the form
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(x-x_{0})^{n}
$$
Moreover, the radius of convergence is at least as large as the distance from $x_{0}$ to it's nearest singular point (real or complex valued). 
#### Example:
${} (x^{2}+1)y''-xy=0 {}$. Then $0$ is an ordinary point, and $\pm i$ are the singular points. Therefore, the radius of convergence is $1$. 

Suppose we have an analytic solution of the form 
$$
\phi(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k} (x-x_{0})^{k}
$$
Note that ${} \phi^{(m)}(x_{0})=m!a_{m} {}$ and ${} \phi(x_{0})=a_{0} {}$. Now
$$
P(x_{0})\phi''(x_{0})+Q(x_{0})\phi'(x_{0})+R(x_{0})\phi(x_{0})=0
$$
so
$$
2a_{2}=\phi''(x_{0})=- \frac{Q(x_{0})}{P(x_{0})} \phi'(x_{0})-\frac{R(x_{0})}{P(x_{0})}\phi(x_{0})
$$
