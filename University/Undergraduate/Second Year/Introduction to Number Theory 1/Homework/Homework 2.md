1. 
a)
Let ${} d \mid n {}$. Then we have
$$
d = q_{1}^{c_{1}} q_{2}^{c_{2}}\dots q_{s}^{c_{s}}
$$
for distinct primes ${} q_{i}$ and positive integers ${} c_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Note that ${} dk=n {}$ for some $k>0 {}$. Now
$$
k=q_{s+1}^{c_{s+1}}\dots q_{s+t}^{c_{s+t}}
$$
for primes ${} r_{i}$ and positive integers ${} d_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. 
$$
p_{1}^{a_{1}}\dots p_{r}^{a_{r}}=n=dk=q_{1}^{c_{1}}\dots q_{s}^{c_{s}}\cdot r_{1}^{d_{1}}\dots r_{t}^{d_{t}}
$$
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, then given some $1\leq i\leq r {}$, then there exists some $1\leq j\leq s+t {}$ such that ${} p_{i}= {}$
