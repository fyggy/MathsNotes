# Structure of ${} \mathbb{Z}_{n}^{\times }  {}$
## Primitive Roots
### Problem:
Determine the positive integers ${} m {}$ for which ${} \mathbb{Z}_{m}^{\times } {}$ is cyclic.
#### Example:
Last time we say that ${} \mathbb{Z}_{9}^{\times } {}$ is cyclic, but ${} \mathbb{Z}_{8}^{\times } {}$ is not. 
#### Example:
${} \mathbb{Z}_{11}^{\times } {}$ is cyclic and is generated by ${} [6]_{11} {}$. 
### Definition 1.1: Primitive Roots
Let ${} m \in \mathbb{N} {}$ and let ${} a \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} \gcd(a,\, m)=1 {}$. If ${} o([a]_{m})=\phi(m) {}$, then $a$ is a primitive root modulo $m$. 
#### Notation: 
Abbreviate primitive root to PR
#### Example:
${} 6 {}$ is a PR modulo ${} 11 {}$
There is no primitive root modulo $8$. 
- If $g$ is a PR modulo $m$, then ${} \mathbb{Z}_{m}^{\times } {}$ is cyclic and
$$
\mathbb{Z}_{m}^{\times }=\{ [g]_{m}^{i} \mid  1\leq i\leq \phi(m) \}
$$
that is, $g$ generates ${} \mathbb{Z}_{m}^{\times } {}$.
### Theorem 1.2: Primitive Root Test
Let ${} m \in \mathbb{N} {}$, ${} a \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} \gcd(a,\, m)=1 {}$, and with $m\geq 3$. Then $a$ is a PR modulo $m$ iff, for each prime ${} p \mid  \phi(m) {}$, then
$$
a^{\phi(m)/p} \not\equiv 1 
$$
