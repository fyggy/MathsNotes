### Definition 1.1: GCD
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. We say that $a {}$ divides $b {}$, and write ${} a \mid b {}$ iff there exists some ${} d \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that ${} ad=b {}$.
#### Example:
${} 11 {}$ divides ${} 143 {}$ 
(skipped a bunch cos it's just divisibility stuff)

$$
\begin{align}
a=md \\
md+b=nd \\
b=(n-m)d
\end{align}
$$

$$
(f \circ  g)(x)=f(g(x))
$$
### Corollary 1.1:
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, with ${} a\neq 0\neq b {}$. The following two sets are equal:
- ${} S=\{ au+bv \mid u,\, v \in \mathbb{Z} \} {}$
- ${} S'=\{ n \cdot  \gcd(a,\, b) \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}\} {}$
#### Proof:
We must show that ${} S \subseteq S' {}$, and ${} S' \subseteq  S {}$.

First, suppose that ${} x \in S {}$. Now ${} s=au+bv {}$ for some ${} u,\, v \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Let ${} d=\gcd(a,\, b) {}$. Then $d\mid a {}$, and ${} d \mid  b {}$. Therefore, ${} d \mid  au+bv {}$ by properties of divisibility. Therefore, there exists some ${} n \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that ${} dn=au+bv=x {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in S'  {}$

Now suppose that ${} x \in  S' {}$. Then ${} x=nd {}$, where ${} d = \gcd(a,\, b) {}$. Thanks to BÃ©zout's lemma, there exist some ${} u,\, v \in  \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that ${} d=au+bv {}$. Now ${} x=n(au+bv)=anu+bnv \in S {}$. Therefore, ${} x \in S {}$, so ${} S=S' {}$
## Coprime Numbers
### Definition 2.1: Coprime numbers
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. If ${} \gcd(a,\, b)=1 {}$, we say that ${} a,\, b {}$ are coprime.
#### Example:
Let ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$, ${} n,\, n+1 {}$ are coprime
