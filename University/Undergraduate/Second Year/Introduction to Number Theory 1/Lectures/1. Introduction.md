### Definition 1.1: GCD
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. We say that $a {}$ divides $b {}$, and write ${} a \mid b {}$ iff there exists some ${} d \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that ${} ad=b {}$.
#### Example:
${} 11 {}$ divides ${} 143 {}$ 
(skipped a bunch cos it's just divisibility stuff)

$$
\begin{align}
a=md \\
md+b=nd \\
b=(n-m)d
\end{align}
$$

$$
(f \circ  g)(x)=f(g(x))
