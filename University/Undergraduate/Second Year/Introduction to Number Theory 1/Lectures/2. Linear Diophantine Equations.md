# Diophantines
## Least Common Multiple 
### Definition 1.1: Least Common Multiple
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} a\neq 0\neq b {}$.We say that ${} c \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ is a *common multiple* of ${} a {}$ and $b {}$ if ${} a \mid c {}$ and ${} b \mid c {}$. We define the *least common multiple* ${} \lcm(a,\, b) {}$ to be the smallest positive common multiple of ${} a {}$ and ${} b {}$. 
#### Remark
Note that if ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, ${} \lcm(a,\, b)\leq ab {}$, as ${} a \mid ab {}$ and ${} b\mid ab {}$.
#### Example:
Find ${} \lcm(3,\, 5) {}$ by brute force. First, list multiples of $3 {}$ and $5 {}$:
- Multiples of $3 {}$: ${} 3,\, 6,\, 9,\, 12,\, 15,\,\dots {}$
- Multiples of $5 {}$: ${} 5,\, 10,\, 15,\, 20,\, 25,\, \dots {}$
Therefore, ${} \lcm(3,\, 5)=15 {}$. (This is already clear as 3 and 5 are coprime)
### Lemma 1.2:
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Suppose that ${} \gcd(a,\, b)=1 {}$. Then ${} \lcm(a,\, b)=ab {}$. 
#### Proof:
Write ${} c=\lcm(a,\, b)>0 {}$. Since ${} c\leq ab {}$. By definition, we know that $a\mid c {}$ and $b\mid c {}$. Since $a {}$ and $b {}$ are coprime, then ${} ab \mid c {}$. Therefore ${} ab=c {}$, as required.
### Proposition 1.3:
Let ${} a \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ and ${} b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Then ${} \lcm(a,\, b)=\frac{|ab|}{\gcd(a,\, b)} {}$.
#### Proof:
Let ${} c=\lcm(a,\, b)>0 {}$, and ${} d=\gcd(a,\, b)\geq 0 {}$. Then ${} a=dx {}$ and ${} b=dy {}$ with ${} \gcd(x,\, y)=1 {}$. #todo 
## Solving Linear Diophantine Equations
### Problem:
Given ${} a,\, b,\, c \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, find all ${} x,\, y \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that 
$$
ax+by=c
$$
#### Example:
We saw that 
$$
132x+84y=12
$$
has the solution ${} x=2 {}$ and $y=-3 {}$.
#### Example:
Consider ${} -x+2y=1 {}$. We may rewrite this as ${} y=\frac{x+1}{2} {}$.Therefore, if $x {}$ is odd, then $y {}$ is an integer, so we have ${} (2n-1,\, n) {}$ as all solutions.
#### Example:
Consider ${} 12x+8y=3 {}$. Then since the ${} \gcd(12,\, 8)=4>3 {}$, then there are no solutions.
### Theorem 2.1:
Let ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ both not zero, and ${} c \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Let ${} d=\gcd(a,\, b) {}$. Then, each of the following hold:
