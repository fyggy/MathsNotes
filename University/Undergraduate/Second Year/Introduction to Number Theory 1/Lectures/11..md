## Primitive Roots to Prime Power Moduli
### Question:
For which ${} m \in \mathbb{N} {}$ is ${} \mathbb{Z}_{m}^{\times } {}$ cyclic?
### Proposition 1.1:
Let $g$ be a PR modulo $p$, with $p$ prime. Then at least one of ${} g,\, g+p {}$ is a primitive root modulo $p^{2} {}$. 
#### Proof:
Write ${} d=o([g]_{p^{2}}) {}$ and ${} e=o([g+p]_{p^{2}}) {}$. We know that ${} d \mid  \phi(p^{2}) {}$, and ${} e \mid  \phi(p^{2}) {}$. We also know that ${} g^{d}\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{2})  {}$. Therefore, ${} g^{d}\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  {}$. By lemma 5.1, we have that ${} o([g]_{p})=\phi(p) {}$ is a multiple of $d$.
