## Quadratic Reciprocity
#### Example:
Determine for which primes $p$ is $5$ is a quadratic residue ${} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  {}$, i.e. when ${} p$ with ${} \left( \frac{5}{p} \right)=1 {}$.
Now
$$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{5}{p} \right)=(-1)^{p-1} \left( \frac{p}{5} \right)=\left( \frac{p}{5} \right)
\end{align}
$$
We know that the quadratic residues in ${} 5 {}$ are ${} 1 {}$ and ${} 4 {}$. Therefore, ${} \left( \frac{p}{5} \right)=1 {}$ iff ${} p\equiv 1,\, 4 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  5)  {}$
# Sums of Two Squares
### Definition 2.1: Sum of Two Squares
An integer ${} m \in \mathbb{N} {}$ is a sum of two squares (SOTS) if there exist ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} m=a^{2}+b^{2} {}$.
