# Hensel's Lemma
## Part 2
Recall that ${} f(x)=c_{n} x^{n}+\dots+c_{1}x+c_{0} {}$ with ${} c_{i} \in \mathbb{Z} {}$
### Problem: Solve
$$
f(x)\equiv 0 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r+1}) \qquad \text{in} \qquad \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r+1}}
$$
### Strategy:
Solve ${} f(x)\equiv 0 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r})  {}$ in ${} \mathbb{Z}_{p^{r}} {}$.
- For each solution $x$ to the above, find all ${} [y]_{p^{r+1}} {}$ with the following:
	- ${} y\equiv x \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r})  {}$
	- ${} f(y)\equiv 0 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r+1})  {}$

### Goal:
Find all ${} t \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  {}$ with ${} f(x_{r}+tp^{r})\equiv 0 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r+1})  {}$, recalling that ${} f(x_{r})\equiv 0\:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r})  {}$.
### Informal Discussion
Observe that since ${} p^{r} \mid tp^{r} {}$, we have that ${} x_{r}+tp^{r} {}$ and ${} x_{r}$ are "close" ${} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p^{r+1})  {}$, that is, "divisibility by powers of $p$". 

Now we use an idea from calculus. If we have some small ${} |h|< \varepsilon {}$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is a "nice" function, then we can have a Taylor expansion:
$$
\begin{align}
 g(x+h) & =g(x)+g'(x)h+g''(x) \frac{h^{2}}{2!}+\dots    \\
 & =\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \frac{g^{(j)}(x)}{j!} h^{j}
 \end{align}
$$
### Lemma 1.1:
Let ${} t \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, ${} r \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. Then for ${} x \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, 
$$
f(x+tp^{r})\equiv f(x)+f'(x)tp^{r}
$$
#### Proof:
Write ${} n=\deg f {}$. Apply Taylor's theorem (or the binomial theorem suffices). We then get that for ${} x,\, h \in \mathbb{R} {}$, 
$$
f(x+h)=\sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(j)}(x)}{j!}h^{j}
$$
Note that
$$
\frac{f^{(j)}(x)}{j!}
$$
is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
