# Sums of Two Squares
#### Example:
Write ${} 1313=101 \cdot 13 {}$ as a SOTS. First note that ${} 101=10^{2}+1^{2} {}$, and ${} 13=3^{2}+2^{2} {}$. Then 
$$
1313=(30-2)^{2}+(20+3)=28^{2}+23^{2}
$$
or
$$
1313=(3-2)^{2}+(1+30)=17^{2}+32^{2}
$$
#### Fact: (non-examinable)
Let ${} \alpha =a+ib \in \mathbb{Z}[i] {}$. Then $\alpha$ is a Gaussian prime iff either
$$
|\alpha|^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}=p
$$
for ${} p \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ prime, or that one of ${} |a|,\, |b| {}$ is a prime $p$ with ${} p\equiv 3 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  {}$. 
#### Examples:
${} 7,\, 3+2i,\, 3-2i {}$ are all primes. 
### Pigeonhole Principle
If ${} m {}$ objects are distributed $n {}$ bins, and $m>n {}$, then at least one bin contains ${} \geq 2 {}$ objects 
#### Example:
Let ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$, and ${} S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} |S|=m,\, m>n {}$. Then there exists ${} a,\, b \in S {}$ with  ${} a\equiv b \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$.
#### Example:
Let $A,\, B {}$ be finite sets, ${} |A|=m {}$, ${} |B|=n {}$, $m>n {}$. Let $f:A\to{}B {}$. Then there exist ${} a_{1},a_{2} \in A {}$ such that ${} a_{1} \neq a_{2} {}$ and ${} f(a_{1})=f(a_{2}) {}$. 
### Lemma 1.1:
Let ${} a,\, n \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, $n>1 {}$, and $n$ is not a square. Then there exists ${} (c_{1},\, d_{1}),\, (c_{2},\, d_{2}) \in \mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z} {}$ with 
$$
0\leq c_{1},\, c_{2},\, d_{1},\, d_{2}<\sqrt{n}
$$
and
1) ${} (c_{1},\, d_{1})\neq (c_{2},\, d_{2}) {}$
2) ${} c_{1}+ad_{1}\equiv c_{2}+ad_{2} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}$
Observe that there exists ${} k \in \mathbb{N} {}$ such that ${} k < \sqrt{n}<k+1 {}$. Then let
$$
S=\{ (c,\, d) \in \mathbb{Z} \times  \mathbb{Z} \mid  0 \leq  c,\, d \leq k\}
$$
and so
$$
|S|=(k+1)^{2}>n
$$
Let ${} f:S \to{} \mathbb{Z}_{n} {}$ given by ${} f((c,\, d))=[c+ad]_{n} {}$. Since ${} (k+1)^{2}>n {}$, then by the PGP, and example 2, we must have a distinct pair ${} (c_{1},\, d_{1}),\, (c_{2},\, d_{2}) \in S {}$ such that
$$
{} c_{1}+ad_{1}\equiv c_{2}+ad_{2} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  n)  {}
$$
### Theorem 1.2:
$p {}$ is a SOTS iff ${} p=2 {}$ or ${} p\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  {}$. 
#### Proof:
Case 1: ${} p=2=1^{2}+1^{2} {}$. 
Case 2:
Last time, we showed that if ${} n \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ is a SOTS, then ${} n\equiv 0,\, 1,\, 2 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  {}$. It remains to show that if ${} p\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  {}$, then $p$ is a SOTS. 

Suppose that ${} p\equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  {}$. Then ${} \left( \frac{ -1 }{ p } \right)=1 {}$, so let ${} b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} b^{2} \equiv -1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  {}$. We utilise the previously proved Lemma with ${} n=p {}$, and ${} a=b {}$. Then we get distinct pairs ${} (c_{1},\, d_{1}),\, (c_{2},\, d_{2}) {}$ such that
$$
c_{1}+bd_{1}\equiv c_{2}+bd_{2} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p) 
$$
and ${} 0\leq c_{1},\, c_{2},\, d_{1},\, d_{2} <\sqrt{p} {}$. Now we have
$$
\begin{align}
c_{1}-c_{2}  & \equiv b (d_{2}-d_{1})  & \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  \\
(c_{1}-c_{2})^{2} & \equiv b^{2}(d_{2}-d_{1})^{2}  & \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p) \\
(c_{1}-c_{2})^{2}+(d_{2}-d_{1})^{2} & \equiv 0 &  \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  
\end{align}
$$
since ${} b^{2}=-1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  p)  {}$. Therefore, there exist some ${} \ell \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ such that
$$
(c_{1}-c_{2})^{2} +(d_{2}-d_{1})^{2} = \ell p
$$
Now at least one of the pairs are non-trivial, and they are all strictly less than ${} 2p {}$. Therefore, ${} \ell=1 {}$, and
$$
(c_{1}-c_{2})^{2}+(d_{2}-d_{1})^{2}=p
$$
and $p$ is a SOTS.
### Theorem 1.3: Two Squares Theorem
An integer ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ is a SOTS iff in it's prime factorisation each prime is which congruent to ${} 3$ modulo $4$ has an even power. 
#### Proof:
Suppose that ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ with ${} n=2^{a_{0}}p_{1}^{b_{1}}\dots p_{r}^{b_{r}}q_{1}^{2e_{1}}\dots q_{s}^{2c_{s}} {}$ where ${} a_{0},\, b_{i},\, c_{i} \in \mathbb{N} {}$, and ${} p_{i},\, q_{i} {}$ are distinct odd primes with 
$$
\begin{align}
 p_{i} & \equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)   \\
q_{i} & \equiv 3 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4) 
 \end{align} 
$$
- We have that ${} 2$ is a SOTS, so ${} 2^{a_{0}}$ is a SOTS
- ${} p_{i}$ is a SOTS by above, so ${} p_{i}^{b_{i}} {}$ is a SOTS
- ${} (q_{i})^{2c_{i}}=(q_{i}^{c_{i}})^{2}+0^{2} {}$ is a SOTS
therefore, $n$ is also a SOTS
