# Sums of Two Squares
## 
#### Example:
Write ${} 1313=101 \cdot 13 {}$ as a SOTS. First note that ${} 101=10^{2}+1^{2} {}$, and ${} 13=3^{2}+2^{2} {}$. Then 
$$
1313=(30-2)^{2}+(20+3)=28^{2}+23^{2}
$$
or
$$
1313=(3-2)^{2}+(1+30)=17^{2}+32^{2}
$$
#### Fact: (non-examinable)
Let ${} \alpha =a+ib \in \mathbb{Z}[i] {}$. Then $\alpha$ is a Gaussian prime iff either
$$
|\alpha|^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}=p
$$
