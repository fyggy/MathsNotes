#### Proof:
For the sake of contradiction suppose that there are finitely many primes 
$$
p_{1},\, p_{2},\, p_{3},\,\dots,\,p_{n}
$$
Let ${} n=\prod p_{k} {}$ and ${} N=n+1 {}$. There exists a prime $p$ with $p \mid N {}$. Also, ${} p=p_{i} {}$ for some ${} i=1,\,\dots,\,r {}$. This, ${} p \mid n {}$. But ${} \gcd(n,\, N)=\gcd(n,\, n+1)=1 {}$, so ${} p \mid 1 {}$ which is a contraction. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes.
### Question:
Does the set 
$$
\{ 4k+3 \mid  k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \}=\{ 7,\, 11,\, 15,\, 19,\, 23,\,\dots \}
$$
contain infinitely many primes?

The answer is yes.
### Theorem 1.1:
There are infinitely many primes of the form ${} 4k+3 {}$, ${} k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. 
#### Note:
Does the proof still work if the form is ${} 4k+1 {}$ instead?
#### Facts:
1. If ${} n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, then ${} n=4k+0 {}$, or ${} n=4k+1 {}$, or, ${} n=4k+2 {}$, or ${} n=4k+3 {}$ by the division algorithm
2. If ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, and ${} a=4k+1 {}$, ${} b=4j+1 {}$, with ${} k,\, j \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, then 
$$
\begin{align}
ab & =(4k+1)(4j+1) \\
  & =16kj+4k+4j+1 \\
  & =4(4kj+k+j)+1 \\
  & =4k'+1 \text{ taking } k'=4kj+k+j
\end{align}
$$
#### Proof:
For the sake of contradiction, assume that there are only finitely many primes of the form ${} 4k+3 {}$. Write them as
$$
p_{1},\, p_{2},\, p_{3},\,\dots,\,p_{r}
$$
Let ${} n=4(p_{1} p_{2}\dots p_{r}) {}$, and ${} N=n-1 {}$. We know that ${} \gcd(n,\, N)=1 {}$. We also know that $N {}$ is odd. Therefore, if a prime ${} p \mid N {}$, then we know that ${} p\neq 4k,\, p\neq 4k+2 {}$, for any ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Since $p \mid N {}$, and $p\nmid n$. Therefore, ${} p\neq 4k+3 {}$ for any ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. Therefore, ${} p=4k+1 {}$.

Therefore, *all* the prime divisors of $N {}$ of the form ${} 4k+1 {}$, and ${} N=4k+1 {}$ for some ${} k \in  \mathbb{Z} {}$. Therefore, ${} n=4k+2 {}$, but ${} n=4j {}$ for some ${} j \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. This is a contradiction, therefore, there are infinitely many primes of the form ${} 4k+3 {}$.
# Modular arithmetic
## Review
### Notation:
Let ${} a,\, b,\, c ,\, m \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} m\neq 0 {}$. We say that $a {}$ is congruent to $b {}$ modulo $m {}$, and write
$$
a\equiv b\:(\mathrm{mod}\  m) 
$$
if ${} m \mid (b-a) {}$, or ${} a=b+km {}$, for some ${} k \in \mathbb{Z} {}$. 
### Fact:
For each ${} m \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, ${} m\neq 0 {}$, we have that
$$
\equiv \:(\mathrm{mod}\  m) 
$$
defines an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$.
#### Example:
$$
\begin{align}
-1=3\:(\mathrm{mod}\  4) &  \iff 4 \mid (3-(-1)) \\
  9 \equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)  &  \iff 4 \mid (9-1) \\
 7 \not \equiv 1 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  4)   & \iff 4 \nmid (7-1)
\end{align}
$$
### Definition 2.1:
Let ${} a,\, m \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with ${} m\neq 0 {}$. Then the equivalence class of $a$ modulo $m {}$ is the set subset of integers ${} b \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with
$$
b\equiv a \:(\mathrm{mod}\  m) 
$$
we define this subset by ${} [a]_{m} {}$ (also called *residue class* of ${} a \:(\mathrm{mod}\  m)  {}$).
#### Example:
$$
\begin{align}
[2]_{3} & =\{ b \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  b\equiv 2 \:(\mathrm{mod}\  3)  \} \\
  & =\{ 3k+2 \mid  k \in \mathbb{Z} \} \\
  & =\{ \dots,\, -4,\, -1,\, 2,\, 5,\, 8,\, \dots \} \\
  & =[-4]_{3} \\
  & =[-1]_{3} \\
  & =[5]_{3} \\
  & \phantom{{}={}} \vdots
\end{align}
$$
### Definition 2.2: Residue Class Arithmetic
For ${} a,\, b ,\, m \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, ${} m\neq 0$, we define
- Addition: ${} [a]_{m}+[b]_{m}=[a+b]_{m} {}$
- Multiplication: ${} [a]_{m}[b]_{m}=[ab]_{m} {}$

We write ${} \mathbb{Z}_{m}$ as the set of equivalence classes modulo $m$, or the ring of integers modulo $m$.
#### Example:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{Z}_{4}  & = \{ [0]_{4},\, [1]_{4},\, [2]_{4},\, [3]_{4} \} \\
  & =\{ [-4]_{4},\, [9]_{4},\, [6]_{4},\, [-1]_{4} \}
\end{align}
$$
### Definition 2.3:
Let ${} m \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ with $m\neq 0$. A set ${} \{ x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{r} \} {}$ is a complete set of residues modulo $m$, if for each ${} y \in \mathbb{Z} {}$ there is exactly one ${} x_{i} {}$ with ${} y \equiv  x_{i} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  i)  {}$. 
#### Example:
${} \{ 0,\, 1,\, 2,\, 3 \} {}$ and ${} \{ -4,\, 9,\, 6,\, -1 \} {}$ are both complete sets of residues ${} \mathrm{mod}\  4  {}$.
