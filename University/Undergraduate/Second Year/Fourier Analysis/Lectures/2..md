## Classes of Functions
### Functions on $\mathbb{R} {}$ or on an Interval
The functions we shall be working with will take values in $\mathbb{C} {}$. We shall be working with:
- Continuous functions
- Piecewise continuous functions
- Riemann integrable functions
### Functions on the circle
We denote the unit circle in the complex plane by ${} \mathbb{T} {}$, that is, 
$$
\mathbb{T}=\{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid  |z|=1 \}=\{ e^{i\theta} \mid  \theta \in  [0,\, 2\pi) \}
$$
Let ${} F: \mathbb{T}\to{}\mathbb{R}  {}$. Then ${} F(e^{i\theta}) {}$ is a $2\pi {}$-periodic function on $\mathbb{R}$, as 
$$
F(e^{i(\theta+2\pi)})=F(e^{i\theta}\cdot e^{i 2\pi})=F(e^{i\theta})
$$
In fact, there is an equivalence between functions on ${} \mathbb{T}$, $2\pi {}$-periodic functions on $\mathbb{R} {}$, and functions on ${} [0,\, 2\pi) {}$.
## Fourier Series
Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ which is $L$-periodic, where ${} \mathbb{R}\ni L>0 {}$. We want to represent $f$ as a sum:
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty} c_{n} e^{2\pi i \frac{ n x }{ L }}
$$
recall that
$$
e^{2\pi i \frac{nx}{L} }=\cos \left( 2\pi \frac{ nx }{ L } \right)+i \sin \left( 2\pi \frac{ nx }{ L } \right)
$$
but it is more convenient to use the exponential form. We refer to the numbers ${} \frac{2\pi}{L}n {}$ as "frequencies". 

Now, what are ${} c_{n}$? We may find that
$$
c_{n}= \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L} f(x)e^{-i \frac{ 2\pi }{ L }nx} \ud x 
$$
