# Fourier Analysis
## Motivation
Let ${} f:\mathbb{R}\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ such that $f {}$ is periodic, for instance with a period of ${} 2\pi {}$: ${} f(x+2\pi)=f(x) {}$. We want to represent this function in terms of the simplest periodic functions, that is, sines and cosines. In particular, 
$$
\begin{align}
\sin (nx),\, \cos (nx),\, n \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align}
$$
This is done by writing
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty} a_{ n} \sin (nx)+b_{n} \cos (nx)
$$
in fact, this can be done for any ${} 2\pi {}$-periodic function. This is called a Fourier series. For most of the course we shall be dealing with the complex form, i.e.
$$
e^{inx}=\cos (nx)+i\sin (nx)
$$
and so we will be representing 
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty} c_{n}e^{inx}
$$
It turns out that there is an explicit formula for the $c_{ n}$:
$$
c_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)e^{-inx} \ud x 
$$
This is the first part of the course

The second part of the course deals with Fourier integrals. This is a continuous version of a Fourier series, in a sense. We will write
$$
f(x)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi x} \ud \xi 
$$
where
$$
\hat{f}(\xi)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty} f(x)e^{-2\pi i\xi x} \ud x 
$$
and we will of course discuss applications. 
### Technical Issues
The main technical issue will the the convergence of the Fourier series
## Continuity and Uniform Continuity
### Definition 1.1: Continuity
Let ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$. We say that ${} f {}$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ if
$$
\forall \varepsilon>0:\forall x \in [a,\, b]:\exists \delta>0:|x-x'|<\delta \Rightarrow  |f(x)-f(x')|<\varepsilon
$$
Note in particular that $\delta$ depends on both $x$ and $\varepsilon {}$. 
### Definition 1.2: Uniform Continuity
Let ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$. We say that $f {}$ is uniformly continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ if
$$
\forall \varepsilon>0:\exists \delta>0:\forall x \in [a,\, b]:|x-x'|<\delta \Rightarrow  |f(x)-f(x')|<\varepsilon
$$
and note tat $\delta$ depends only ${} \varepsilon {}$.
#### Example:
Let ${} f(x)=\sin (x^{2}) {}$. This is continuous, but is not uniformly continuous, 
### Theorem 1.3: Cantor's Theorem
If $f$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$, then it is uniformly continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$.
