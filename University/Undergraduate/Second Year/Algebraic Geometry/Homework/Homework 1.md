1. 
Since $f$ is non-constant, and $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically complete, then $f$ must have at least $1$ root, ${} \mathbf{r}=(r_{1},\,\dots,\,r_{n}) {}$. Therefore, ${} f(\mathbf{r})=0 {}$, and so ${} \mathbf{r} \in A=\{ \mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{C}^{n} \mid  f(\mathbf{a})=0 \}\neq \varnothing  {}$. Now suppose that $n\geq 2$. Let ${} r_{i}^{j}:\mathbb{C}\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ be the $i^{\text{th}} {}$ principle value of the $j^{\text{th}} {}$ root. WLOG suppose that $f {}$ is non constant in its first variable. Then we may rewrite $f$
