## Intro
### What is AG about?
The general goal of AG is to study systems of polynomial equations, i.e.:
$$
\begin{align}
p_{1}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{ m}) & =0 \\
 & \vdots  \\
p_{n}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{m}) & =0
\end{align}
$$
where ${} p_{ i} {}$ are polynomials in $m$ variables. If the ${} p_{i}$ are all linear, then this is simply linear algebra. Otherwise, this is extremely chall
