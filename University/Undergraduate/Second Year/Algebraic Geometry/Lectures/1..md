# Introduction
## Intro
### What is AG about?
The general goal of AG is to study systems of polynomial equations, i.e.:
$$
\begin{align}
p_{1}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{ m}) & =0 \\
 & \vdots  \\
p_{n}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{m}) & =0
\end{align}
$$
where ${} p_{ i} {}$ are polynomials in $m$ variables. If the ${} p_{i} {}$ are all linear, then this is simply linear algebra. Otherwise, this is extremely challenging. 

In practice, many geometric spaces are defined by polynomials. For instance, the circle is simply the solution set to
$$
x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0
$$

Polynomials are the "simplest" equations, and so they appear everywhere and anywhere. AG allows us to unify different fields, e.g. the unification between number theory and geometry, which comes together to make arithmetic geometry. 
### Goals for today
1. The natural setting for geometry is the projective plane. 
2. (for geometry) $\mathbb{C}$ is better than $\mathbb{R}$. 
## Classification of Conics
Define a quadratic polynomial in $x$ and $y$ is
$$
Q(x,\, y)=ax^{2}+by^{2}+cxy+dx+ey+f
$$
and at least one of ${} a,\, b,\, c\neq 0 {}$. We define a conic to be the zero locus or zero set of $Q$, that is, 
$$
C=\{ (A,\, B)  \in  \mathbb{R}^{2}\mid  Q(A,\, B)=0 \}
$$
There are many "classes" of conic:
1. Ellipses: ${} x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0 {}$
2. Hyperbolae: ${} x^{2}-y^{2}-1=0 {}$
3. Parabolas: ${} x^{2}-y-1=0 {}$
4. The empty set: ${} x^{2}+y^{2}+1=0 {}$
5. The origin: $x^{2}+y^{2}=0 {}$
6. Axes: ${} xy=0 {}$
7. Parallel lines: ${} (x-1)x=0 {}$
8. The double line: ${} (x-1)^{2}=0 {}$
## Real Projective Plane
Idea: Compactify the plane in a geometrically meaningful way. We denote the real projective plane as
$$
\begin{align}
 \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{R}}^{2} & =\{ \text{lines through the origin in }\mathbb{R}^{3} \}   \\
 & =\{ \text{ratios of the form }[X:Y:Z] \} \\
 & =(\mathbb{R}^{3}-\{ 0 \}) / \sim \qquad\text{where}\qquad  (X,\, Y,\, Z)\sim (tX,\, tY,\, tZ),\, t \in \mathbb{R}-\{ 0 \}
 \end{align}
$$
Notice that any line through the origin is defined by a non-origin point ${} (A,\, B,\, C) {}$. Two points define the same line iff non-zero scalar multiples of each other, i.e. ${} (A,\, B,\, C)\sim (tA,\, tB,\, tC) {}$.

${} \mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{R}} {}$ has a topology; the quotient topology. That is
$$
U \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{R}}
$$
is open iff
$$
q^{-1}(U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}-\{ 0 \}
$$
is open, where ${} q:\mathbb{R}^{3} -\{ 0 \}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{R}} {}$ is the quotient map.
