# Cubics
## 
### 
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field with ${} \Char K \neq 2,\, 3 {}$, and let ${} C=\{ f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{k}^{2}, {}$ where $\deg f=3 {}$. Lets assume that $C$ is a "smooth" curve. Intuitively, $C$ does not intersect itself and has no sharp bends (no cusps). Furthermore, the gradient vector field ${} \nabla f=\left( \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } ,\, \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } ,\, \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z }  \right) {}$ is non-zero.
### Lemma 1.1:
Let ${} C \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{2} {}$ be a smooth cubic defined by ${} \{ f(X,\, Y,\, Z) =0\} {}$. Let ${} P_{0}=[X_{0},\, Y_{0},\, Z_{0}] {}$ be a point on $C$, and let ${} [A:B:C]=\left[ \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } (P_{0}): \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } (P_{0}): \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } (P_{0})\right] {}$ (this is well defined as $f {}$ is smooth). Then the line
$$
L=\{ AX+BY+CZ= 0\} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K}
$$
is tangent to $C$ at $P_{0}$. Moreover, ${} P_{0}  {}$ appears in the intersection of ${} L {}$ and $C {}$ with multiplicity ${} 2 {}$. 
#### Proof (sketch)
The multivariate Taylor series expansion of $f$ about the point ${} (X_{0},\, Y_{0},\, Z_{0}) {}$ is
$$
f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } (P_{0})(X-X_{0})+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } (P_{0})(Y-Y_{0})+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } (P_{0})(Z-Z_{0})+r(X,\, Y,\, Z)
$$
where $r$ has terms of order $\geq 2$.
