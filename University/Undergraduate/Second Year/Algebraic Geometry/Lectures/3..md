# Cubics
## 
### 
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field with ${} \Char K \neq 2,\, 3 {}$, and let ${} C=\{ f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{k}^{2}, {}$ where $\deg f=3 {}$. Lets assume that $C$ is a "smooth" curve. Intuitively, $C$ does not intersect itself and has no sharp bends (no cusps). Furthermore, the gradient vector field ${} \nabla f=\left( \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } ,\, \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } ,\, \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z }  \right) {}$ is non-zero.
### Lemma 1.1:
Let ${} C \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{2} {}$ be a smooth cubic defined by ${} \{ f(X,\, Y,\, Z) =0\} {}$. Let ${} P_{0}=[X_{0},\, Y_{0},\, Z_{0}] {}$ be a point on $C$, and let ${} [A:B:C]=\left[ \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } (P_{0}): \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } (P_{0}): \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } (P_{0})\right] {}$ (this is well defined as $f {}$ is smooth). Then the line
$$
L=\{ AX+BY+CZ= 0\} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K}
$$
is tangent to $C$ at $P_{0}$. Moreover, ${} P_{0}  {}$ appears in the intersection of ${} L {}$ and $C {}$ with multiplicity ${} 2 {}$. 
#### Proof (sketch)
The multivariate Taylor series expansion of $f$ about the point ${} (X_{0},\, Y_{0},\, Z_{0}) {}$ is
$$
f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } (P_{0})(X-X_{0})+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } (P_{0})(Y-Y_{0})+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } (P_{0})(Z-Z_{0})+r(X,\, Y,\, Z)
$$
where $r$ has terms of order $\geq 2 {}$. The linear part is the best linear approximation around the tangent line. 

We now explain the claim on multiplicities. Up to a change of coordinates, we may assume ${} P=[0:0:1] {}$ and ${} [A:B:C]=[1:0:0] {}$. 
## Group Law on a Cubic Curve
Fix some ${} \mathbb{0} \in C \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{2} {}$, where $C {}$ is a cubic. Let ${} P,\, Q \in C {}$, and let $L$ be the line between $P$ and $Q$ (if $P=Q {}$, we take $L {}$ to be the tangent line). By BÃ©zout's Theorem, there is a third point of intersection, $R$:

Let $L' {}$ be the line between ${} \mathbb{0}$ and $R {}$. This gives us a third point,  $P+Q {}$:![[Pasted image 20250131165329.png]]
We claim that this addition gives a abelian group.

Let ${} L_{\mathbb{0}} {}$ be the tangent line to ${} C$ at ${} \mathbb{0}$, and let $A$ be the third point of intersection of ${} L_{\mathbb{0}} {}$ with $C$. Let ${} P \in C {}$ be any point, and let $L$ be the line through $P$ and $A$. There is a third point of intersection, call it $R$. 

By definition, to add $R$ and $P {}$, we first find the third point of intersection of the line through ${} P$ and $R$; this is $A$. Now the third point of intersection between $A$ and ${} \mathbb{0}$ is ${} \mathbb{0}$, so ${} R+P=\mathbb{0} {}$. 

A similar strategy shows that ${} \mathbb{0}$ is the identity, and associativity won't be proved but is either extremely tedious or fucky an technical. 
#### Fact:
If $K=\mathbb{C}$, ${} C~ \cong S^{1} \times  S^{1} {}$, both topologically and as a group. In fact, it is a Lie Group.
### Remark:
When ${} K=\conj{\mathbb{F}_{p}} {}$, this is the basis of elliptic curve cryptography. The heart of this cryptographic system is the fact that if $P$ is a point and ${} Q=nP {}$, then it is very hard to find $n$ from $P$ and $Q$. 
### Simpler Form of the Group Law
Up to a projective linear change of coordinates, we can assume that our cubic is given by ${} Y^{2}Z-(X^{3}+aXZ^{2}+BZ^{3}) \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{2} {}$. Then ${} [0:1:0] \in C {}$ has a very special property. The tangent line to $C$ at ${} [0:1:0] {}$ is ${} \{ Z=0 \} {}$ (check #todo). Then
$$
f(X,\, Y,\, 0)=X^{3}
$$
so ${} \{ Z=0 \} {}$ intersects $C$ at ${} [0:1:0] {}$ to order $3$. If we take ${} [0:1:0] {}$ as our identity element, the group law is very simple: in the coordinates $x=\frac{X}{Z} {}$, $y=\frac{Y}{Z} {}$, then 
$$
C=\{ y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b \}
$$
and we may draw the addition like so:
![[Pasted image 20250131173040.png]]
If ${} P=[\alpha:\beta:1] \in C {}$, and let $L {}$ be the line through ${} [0:1:0] {}$ and ${} [\alpha:\beta:1]$. Then the third point of intersection of $L$ with $C$ is ${} [\alpha:-\beta:1] {}$.
#### Proof:
First of all, ${} f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=f(X,\, -Y,\, Z) {}$, so ${} [\alpha:-\beta:1] {}$ really is a point on $C$. Now ${} [\alpha:\beta:1],\, [\alpha:-\beta:1],\, [0:1:0] {}$ all lie on a line, namely, ${} \{ X-\alpha Z=0 \} {}$. 
### Theorem 
In the setting above, the group law is characterized by the fact that ${} P+Q+R=\mathbb{0} {}$ iff ${} P,\, Q,\, R {}$ are colinear. 
## Flex Lines
A line $L$ such that ${} L \cap C {}$ is a single point of multiplicity $3$ is called a flex line. Given ${} f \in K[X,\, Y,\, Z] {}$ which is degree $3 {}$ homogenous, then define
$$
\mathcal{H}(f)=\text{matrix of second partial derivatives}
$$
and
$$
H(f)=\det \mathcal{H}(f)
$$
then ${} H(f)$ is again homogenous of degree $3$. 
### Theorem 
Let $P$ be a point of intersection between ${} \{ f=0 \} \cap  \{ H(f) =0\} {}$. Then the tangent line to $C$ at $P {}$ is a flex line. In fact, BÃ©zout's theorem tells us that there are ${} 9 {}$ flex lines, up to multiplicity.
#### Proof:
After a change in coordinates, we may assume that ${} P$ is the point ${} [0:0:1] {}$, and the tangent line at $P$ is given by
$$
\left\{  \frac{ \partial f }{ \partial x } (0,\, 0,\, 1)X+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial y } (0,\, 0,\, 1)Y+\frac{ \partial f }{ \partial z } (0,\, 0,\, 1)Z=0  \right\}
$$
Perhaps changing coordinates again, we may assume that this tangent line is just ${} X=0 {}$. Then ${} f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=XZ^{2}+Z(aX^{2}+bXY=cY^{2})+f_{3}(X,\, Y) {}$, where $f_{3} {}$ is homogenous degree $3 {}$ in terms of $X {}$ and $Y {}$. Our tangent line is a flex line iff ${} c=0 {}$. Now
$$
f(0,\, Y,\, Z)=cY^{2}Z+\text{terms of higher order in }Y
$$
Now
$$
\mathcal{H}(f)=\begin{pmatrix}2aZ & bZ & 2Z+2aX+bY \\ bZ & 2cZ & bX+2cY \\ 2Z+2aX+bY & bX+2cY & 2X \end{pmatrix} +\mathcal{H}(f_{3})
$$
and so
$$
\mathcal{H}(f)(0,\, 0,\, 1)=\begin{pmatrix}2a & b & 2 \\ b & 2c & 0 \\ 2 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} +\mathcal{H}(f_{3})(0,\, 0,\, 1)
$$
and so by assumption, ${} \det \mathcal{H}(f))(0,\, 0,\, 1)=0=-8c {}$, so ${} c=0 {}$, and $f$ gives a flex line.
