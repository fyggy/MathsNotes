### 
${} \frac{f}{g} {}$ is not well defined as a function since
1) We have a "pole" along the locus ${} \{ g=0 \} {}$
2) We have an "indeterminacy" along the locus ${} \{ f=g=0 \} {}$

Note that $1 {}$ is not that big of an issue: we may re-imagine our rational function as a morphism* to ${} \mathbb{P}^{1}$, namely ${} F=[f:g]:X\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$. The point at infinity, that is ${} [1:0] {}$, has preimage ${} F^{-1}([1:0])=\{ g=0 \} {}$. Away from the set ${} \{ g=0 \} {}$, ${} F {}$ may be written as 
$$
F=\left[ \frac{f}{g}:1 \right]:X - \{ g=0 \}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} - \{ [1:0] \}\cong K
$$
and so we may recover ${} f /g {}$. 

However, issue $2$ is more serious, and cannot be avoided. However, we will explain later why the "indeterminacy locus" is usually "small". An intuitive explanation is the following: suppose ${} X=\mathbb{P}^{n} {}$, and ${} f,\, g {}$ have a common factor, say, ${} f=hf_{0} {}$, and ${} g=hg_{0} {}$. Note that ${} [f:g] {}$ and ${} [f_{0}:g_{0}] {}$ define "equivalent" rational maps. If $f_{0}$ and $g_{0}$ are coprime, then the indeterminacy locus ${} \{ f_{0}=g_{0}=0 \} {}$ contains no hypersurfaces, thanks to the nullstellensatz. 
#### Example:
The indeterminacy locus of a rational map ${} \mathbb{P}^{2}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$ is a finite set of points. 

More generally, the key fact we needed was that ${} K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ is a UFD. 
### Theorem 1.2:
Let $V$ be an affine algebraic set, and suppose that ${} K(V)=K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] / I(V) {}$ is a UFD. Then any rational morphism ${} f:V\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$ is equivalent to a rational morphism whose indeterminacy locus does not contain any hypersurfaces.

Therefore, we are interested in when $K[V]$ is a UFD (i.e. what does this mean geometrically)

### Theorem 1.3: 
Let $X$ be a smooth algebraic set. Then $K[X]$ is a UFD. 

So smoothness implies unique factorisation. The converse is not true: Consider
$$
\mathbb{C}[x,\, y,\, z,\, w] / (x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+w^{3})
$$
which is a UFD, but ${} \{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+w^{3}=0\} {}$ fails to be smooth at ${} \mathbf{0}=(0,\, 0,\, 0,\, 0) {}$. 
The study of singularities is a big field. A major theorem is called "resolution of singularities by blow ups"
#### Example:
Let $C$ be a smooth algebraic curve, e.g. of the form ${} \{ f=0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{P} ^{2} {}$ or $K^{2} {}$. Then hypersurfaces in $C$ are points, so if a rational map defined on $C$ has no hypersurfaces in it's indeterminacy locus, then it's indeterminacy locus is empty (that is, it's defined everywhere). 
### Theorem 1.4:
There is a one-to-one correspondence between morphisms ${} F:C\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$ and elements in $K[C]$.
