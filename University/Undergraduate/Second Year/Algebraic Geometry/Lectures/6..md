### Proof of Nullstellensatz
Property 1:
Let ${} M \subset  K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] {}$ be a maximal ideal. Consider the quotient map
$$
r:K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] \to{} A = K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] / M
$$
Note that ${} A$ is a field, and that $A$ is a finitely generated $K {}$-algebra. Then theorem 1.7 from [[University/Undergraduate/Second Year/Algebraic Geometry/Lectures/5.|5.]] implies that ${} A$ is a finite field extension of $K$, and since ${} K=\bar{K} {}$, then $K=A {}$.  Set ${} a_{i}=r(x_{i}) {}$. Now
$$
r(x_{i}-a_{i})=r(x_{i})-r(r(x_{i}))=0
$$
as $r {}$ is a ${} K {}$-homomorphism. Therefore, ${} x_{i}-a_{i} \in M {}$, so ${} (x_{1}-a_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}-a_{n}) \subseteq M {}$. However, ${} (x_{1}-a_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}-a_{n}) {}$ is already maximal ( #todo: check). Therefore, 
$$
M=(x_{1}-a_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}-a_{n})
$$
Property 2:
By definition, if $M$ is maximal, then ${} 1 \notin M {}$. Now ${} 1 \notin J {}$ iff there exists a maximal ideal ${} M \supseteq  J {}$. By previous, if ${} J \subseteq M {}$, then ${} V(J) \supseteq V(M) {}$. Now ${} V(M)=(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) {}$, and we conclude that ${} V(J)\neq \varnothing  {}$ iff there exists some point ${} (a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) {}$ such that ${} (a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) \in J {}$.

Property 3:
Note that $I(V(J))$ is always radical, so ${} \rad J \subseteq I(V(J)) {}$. Now suppose BWOC that there exists some ${} f \in I(V(J)) - \rad J {}$. We claim that there exists a maximal ideal $N$ such that ${} f \notin N {}$ and ${} \rad J \subseteq N {}$. 

Proof:
Consider the following finitely generated $K$-algebra. We have 
$$
R=K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n},\, z] / (zf-1)
$$
Clearly we have an injection ${} K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}]\to{}R {}$. Furthermore, the unites of $R$ are ${} K -\{ 0 \} {}$, and ${} z^{m} {}$ and ${} f^{m} {}$ for all ${} m \in \mathbb{N} {}$.
