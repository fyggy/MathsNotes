#### Example
Let $K=\mathbb{R} {}$, and let ${} f(x,\, y)=x^{2}+y^{2} \in \mathbb{R}[x,\, y] {}$. Then ${} V((f))=\{(0,\, 0)\} {}$. Then ${} I(\{ (0,0) \})=\{ g \in \mathbb{R}[x,\, y] \mid  g(0,\, 0)=0 \}=(x,\, y) {}$. Then ${} (f) \subset I(V((f)))=(x,\, y) {}$. This is because $\mathbb{R} {}$ is not algebraically closed. 

If try the same example over ${} \mathbb{C}$ then you find this behaves better. 
#### Example:
Consider ${} f(x)=x^{2} \in \mathbb{R}[x] {}$. Then ${} V((f))=\{ 0 \} {}$, but ${} I(\{ 0 \})=(x) {}$.
## Prime and radical ideals
Let $R$ be a ring (commutative), and let ${} I \subseteq   R {}$ be an ideal. We say that $I {}$ is *prime* if $I\neq R {}$ whenever ${} fg \in I {}$ then ${} f \in I {}$ or ${} g \in I {}$. 

We say that $I$ is radical if whenever ${} f^{m} \in I {}$, then ${} f \in I {}$. (show that all prime ideals are radical).
### Lemma 1.1:
Let $R$ be a ring and let ${} I\subseteq R {}$ be an ideal. Then ${} \rad (I)=\sqrt{I}=\{ f \in R \mid  \exists n : f^{n} \in I \} {}$. We claim that this is an ideal, and ${} I \subseteq \rad (I) {}$.
#### Proof:
Clearly, ${} 0 \in \rad (I) {}$. Now, let ${} f,\, g \in \rad (I) {}$, and let ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ such that ${} f^{n},\, g^{n} \in I {}$. Then 
$$
(f+g)^{2n}=\sum_{k=0}^{2n} \binom{2n}{k} f^{2n-k}g^{k}
$$
Now note that either ${} f^{n} \mid f^{2n-k}g^{k} {}$ or ${} g^{n} \mid  f^{2n-k}g^{k} {}$. Therefore, since $I$ is an ideal, then ${} f^{2n-k}g^{k} \in I {}$, so ${} (f+g)^{2n} \in I {}$, and ${} f+g \in \rad (I) {}$. 

Finally let ${} f \in \rad (I) {}$, and let ${} r \in R {}$, and let ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ such that ${} f^{n} \in I {}$. Then ${} (rf)^{n}=r^{n}f^{n} \in I {}$, so ${} rf \in \rad (I) {}$. Therefore, ${} \rad (I) {}$ is an ideal.
#### Remark:
Note that ${} \rad (I) {}$ is radical, and ${} \rad (I) {}$ is the smallest radical ideal containing ${} I {}$.  Proof: fuck you
### Definition 1.2: Irreducible algebraic sets
Let ${} X \subseteq  K^{n} {}$ be an algebraic set. We say that $X$ is *reducible* if ${} X=X_{1} \cup  X_{2} {}$, where ${} X_{i}$ is an algebraic set and ${} X_{i} \neq X {}$. We say that $X$ is *irreducible* if it is not reducible.
### Proposition 1.3:
Let ${} X \subseteq K^{n} {}$ be an algebraic set. Then $X$ is irreducible iff $I(X)$ is prime.
