# Morphisms
## Functions on Algebraic sets
Let ${} X \subseteq  K^{n} {}$ be an algebraic set, and let ${} I=I(X) {}$. We define ${} K[X]=K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] / I {}$. We call this the ring of polynomial (or regular) functions on $X$. Let ${} f \in K[X] {}$. 
### Claim
We claim that ${} f {}$ defines a function ${} X \to{}K {}$,
#### Proof:
Let ${} F \in K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] {}$ such that ${} f=F \:(\mathrm{mod}\  I)  {}$, and define ${} f(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n})=F(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) {}$ for a point ${} \mathbf{a} = (a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) \in X {}$. We must check that this is well defined.  Let ${} \tilde{F} \in K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] {}$ such that ${} f=\tilde{F} \:(\mathrm{mod}\  I)  {}$. Since ${} F-\tilde{F} \in I {}$, then ${} (F-\tilde{F})(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n})=0 {}$. Therefore, 
$$
\tilde{F}(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n})=F(a_{1},\,\dots,\,a_{n})
$$
as required. 
### Remark
$K$ is an algebraic set. One should think of $f {}$ as a morphism of algebraic sets ${} f:X \to{}K {}$. 
## Polynomial mappings (or morphisms) between algebraic sets
Let ${} X \subseteq K^{n} {}$ and ${} Y \subseteq K^{m} {}$ be two
