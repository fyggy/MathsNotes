## Morphisms of projective algebraic sets
### Definition 1.1: Morphisms from Affine algebraic sets to projective algebraic sets
Let ${} X \subseteq K^{n} {}$ be an affine algebraic set, and let ${} Y \in \mathbb{P}^{m}_{K} {}$ be a projective algebraic set. A morphism $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is a function of the form
$$
f(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n})=[F_{0}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}):\dots :F_{m}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n})]
$$
where the ${} F_i \in K[X] {}$, such that
$$
\{ F_{0} =F_{1}=\dots =F_{m}=0\}\cap X=\varnothing 
$$
Note however that there is no homogeneity required.
#### Example:
Let
$$
f(t)=[t^{2}:t^{3}:1]
$$
is a morphism from ${} K\to{}\mathbb{P}_{K}^{3} {}$. However, 
$$
f(t)=[t^{3}:t^{4}:t]
$$
is not a well defined morphism when ${} t=0 {}$. 


Recall that, given a projective algebraic set ${} V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K} {}$, 
$$
V_{i}=V \cap  \{  X_{i} \neq 0 \} \subseteq \{ X_{i} \neq 0 \}\cong K^{n}
$$

Note that ${} V_{i} \subseteq K^{n} {}$ is an affine algebraic set. Therefore, if ${} V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K},\, Y \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{m}_{K} {}$ are projective algebraic sets, then a function $f:V\to{}Y {}$ is a morphism iff ${} f_{|V_{i}}:V_{i} \to{}Y {}$ is a morphism from an affine algebraic set to a projective algebraic set.
### Proposition 1.2:
Let ${} X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K} {}$ be a projective algebraic set and let ${} F_{0},\,\dots,\,F_{m} \in K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ be degree $d$ homogeneous polynomials such that ${} \{ F_{0}=\dots =F_{m}=0 \}\cap X=\varnothing  {}$. Then 
$$
F=[F_{0}:\dots :F_{m}]:X\to{}\mathbb{P}^{n}_{K}
$$
is a morphism
#### Proof:
We leave it as an exercise to show that $f$ is well defined. To show that $F$ is a morphism, we need to look at $F$ on the set ${} \{ X_{0}\neq 0 \} \cap  X {}$. The other sets can be handled in a similar way. 

Recall that we have affine coordinates ${} x_{i}=\frac{X_{i}}{X_{0}} {}$ on ${} \{ X_{0} \neq 0\} {}$. We define ${} f_{k}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n})=F_{k}\left( 1,\, \frac{X_{1}}{X_{0}},\,\dots,\, \frac{X_{n}}{X_{0}} \right) {}$. On the set ${} \{ X_{0} \neq 0 \} {}$, we have that
$$
\begin{align}
 [f_{0}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}):\dots :f_{m}(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n})] & =[X_{0}^{-d} F_{0}(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}):\dots :X_{0}^{-d}F_{m}(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{0}n)]   \\
 & =[ F_{0}(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}):\dots :F_{m}(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{0}n)] 
 \end{align}
$$
since ${} X_{0}^{-d}\neq 0 {}$. Note that ${} \{ f_{0}=\dots =f_{m} =0\}\cap  X=\varnothing  {}$, and so ${} [f_{0}:\dots :f_{m}]:X \cap  \{ X_{0} \neq 0 \}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{m}_{K} {}$ gives a well defined morphism, which is equal to the restriction of $F$ to ${} X_{0}\neq 0 {}$. Therefore, $F$ is a morphism.
#### Example:
Consider the conic ${} C=\{ XY-Z^{2}=0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2} {}$. Recall that we show that the conics are *parameterised*, that is, there exists a bijective morphism ${} f:\mathbb{P}^{1}\to{}C {}$ with ${} f([S:T])\to{}[S^{2}:T^{2}:ST] {}$. Define ${} g:C\to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$. Let ${} C_{0}=\{ [0:1:0] \} {}$ and ${} C_{1}=C-\{ [1:0:0] \} {}$. On $C_{0}$, we define ${} g([a:b:c])=[a:c] {}$, and on $C_{1}$ we define ${} g([a:b:c])=[c:b] {}$. We claim that this is well defined. 

Let ${} [a:b:c] \in C_{0} \cap  C_{1} {}$. Note that ${} [a:b:c] {}$ are all non-zero, due to the properties of the equation. Now
$$
[a:c]=[ca:c^{2}]=[ca:ab]=[c:b]
$$
This tells us that $g$ is well defined. Note that ${} g {}$ is also a morphism, and ${} g \circ f:\mathbb{P}^{1} \to{}\mathbb{P}^{1} {}$ is the identity. Therefore, $f$ is an isomorphism. 
#### Example: Segre embedding
Fix $n>0 {}$ and $d>0 {}$, and consider the set of all monomials of degree equal to $d$ in $n+1 {}$ variables, i.e., 
$$
X_{0}^{a_{0}}\cdot{\dots}\cdot X_{n}^{a_{n}}\qquad  a_{0}+\dots+a_{n}=d
$$
there are ${} \binom{n+d}{d}  {}$ such monomials. We get a morphism
$$
s:\mathbb{P}^{n}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{N}\qquad N=\binom{n+d}{d} -1
$$
mapping
$$
[X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}]\mapsto [X_{0}^{a_{0}}\cdot{\dots}\cdot X_{n}^{a_{n}}]_{a_{0}+\dots+a_{n}=d}
$$
for example, ${} n=1 {}$, ${} d=3 {}$, we have
$$
s([X:Y])=[X^{3}:X^{2}Y:XY^{2}:Y^{3}]
$$
### Theorem 1.3:
The image of the Segre embedding is a projective algebraic set $X$ (moreover, $X$ is isomorphic to ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}$).
#### Proof (sketch)
Let ${} \mathbf{a}=(a_{0},\,\dots,\,a_{n}) {}$ such that ${} a_{0}+\dots+a_{n}=d {}$. We label the coordinates on ${} \mathbb{P}^{N} {}$ by these tuples, that is, ${} [Y_{\mathbf{a}}] {}$ is our homogeneous coordinate. Define ${} X^{\mathbf{a}}=X_{0}^{a_{0}}\dots X_{n}^{a_{n}} {}$. The equations defining the image of $s$ are 
$$
\{Y_{\mathbf{a}}Y_{\mathbf{b}}-Y_{\mathbf{c}}Y_{\mathbf{d}}:\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{d}\}
$$
Since ${} X^{\mathbf{a}}X^{\mathbf{b}}=X^{\mathbf{c}}X^{\mathbf{d}} {}$ whenever ${} \mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{d} {}$, we deduce that the image of $s$ is contained in 
$$
\{Y_{\mathbf{a}}Y_{\mathbf{b}}-Y_{\mathbf{c}}Y_{\mathbf{d}}=0:\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{d}\}
$$
It remains to show equality, which is left as an exercise. 
#### Remark:
When ${} n=1 {}$ and ${} d=2 {}$, then the parameterisation of a conic in ${} \mathbb{P}^{3}$ is the Segre embedding. Try to generalise $g$ to find the inverse in general. 
## Coordinate Ring of projective algebraic set
Let ${} X \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K} {}$ be a projective algebraic set, and let ${} I(X) \subseteq K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ be a homogeneous ideal defining $X$, i.e. ${} I(X)=(f_{1},\,\dots,\,f_{r}) {}$, where ${} f_{i} {}$ is homogeneous of degree ${} d_{i}$. We define the coordinate ring of $X$ to be
$$
K_{+}[X]=K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] / I(X)
$$
Note: $K_{+}[X]$ is exactly the ring of functions on the affine algebraic set ${} q^{-1}(X) \cup \{ 0 \} {}$ where ${} q:K^{n+1} -\{ 0 \} \to{}\mathbb{P}^{n} {}$ is the quotient map. 

But! Elements of $K_{+}[X]$ do not define functions on $X$. The plus is supposed to remind us of this. $K_{+}[X]$ is a *graded ring*. 

A ring $R$ is graded if 
1) The underlying additive group decomposes as a direct sum ${} \bigoplus_{d=0}^{\infty }R_{d} {}$ and
2) ${} R_{m} R_{n} \subseteq R_{m+n} {}$. 
#### Example:
${} K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ is a graded ring, with ${} R_{d}$ being the set of degree $d$ homogeneous polynomials.
### Lemma 1.4:
Let ${} X \in \mathbb{P}^{n} {}$ be a projective algebraic set. Then the quotient of the grading on ${} K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ by degree gives a grading on $K_{+}[X] {}$. 
#### Remark:
It is critical for $I(X)$ to be a homogeneous ideal for this to be true. For instance, there is no compatible grading between ${} K[X,\, Y]$ and ${} K[X,\, Y] / (X-Y^{2}) {}$. 
#### Proof:
Look at typed notes
#### Example:
The ring morphism ${} K[x,\, y]\to{}K[X,\, Y,\, Z] {}$ defined by $x\mapsto X$, $y\mapsto Y$ is a graded ring morphism. This defines a morphism ${} K^{3}\to{}K^{2} {}$ mapping ${} (x,\, y,\, z)\mapsto (x,\, y) {}$. However, this does not give a morphism of projective algebraic sets. This is because ${} (x,\, y,\, z)\mapsto (x,\, y) {}$ is not well defined at ${} [0:0: 1] {}$. 

We bring this up to show that there is no clear correspondence between graded ring morphisms and projective algebraic set morphisms, analogous to the statement that it is for affine algebraic sets. 
### Theorem 1.5:
Let ${} F:\mathbb{P}^{n}\to{}X {}$ be a morphism where $X$ is an affine algebraic set. Then $F$ is constant. 
#### Remark
Take $X=K {}$. This tells us that the only polynomial functions on projective space are the constants. 
#### Proof:
If ${} X \subseteq K^{m}\to{\pi_{i}}K {}$, where ${} \pi_{i}$ is simply taking the $i^{\text{th}} {}$ coordinate. Note that if ${} \pi_{i} \circ F:X\to{}K {}$ is constant for all $i$, then $F$ is constant. Therefore, WLOG we may assume that $X=K {}$. Let 
$$
\frac{X_{1}}{X_{0}},\,\dots,\,\frac{ X_{n} }{ X_{0} }
$$
be the affine coordinates on ${} x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n} {}$ on ${} \{ X_{0}\neq 0 \} {}$, and let
$$
\frac{X_{0}}{X_{1}},\,\dots,\, \frac{X_{n}}{X_{1}}
$$
be the affine coordinates ${} y_{1},\,\dots,\,y_{n} {}$ on ${} \{ X_{1}\neq 0 \} {}$. 
$$
\frac{X_{i}}{X_{0}} \cdot  \frac{X_{0}}{X_{1}}=\frac{X_{i}}{X_{1}}\qquad \text{ so }\qquad x_{i} \cdot x_{1}^{-1} =y_{i}
$$
Let ${} F:\mathbb{P}^{n}\to{}K {}$ be a morphism on the set ${} \{ X_{0}\neq 0 \} {}$. Then $F$ is given by a polynomial ${} f(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}) {}$ on ${} \{ X_{0}\neq 0 \} {}$, and is given by ${} g(y_{1},\,\dots,\,y_{n}) {}$ on ${} \{ X_{1} \neq 0 \} {}$. We have that ${} f=g {}$ on ${} \{ X_{1}\neq 0\neq X_{0} \} {}$ so if we express $g$ in terms of the ${} x_{i}$, we must get ${} f(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}) {}$. In other words, ${} g(y_{1},\,\dots,\,y_{n})=g\left( \frac{1}{x_{1}} ,\, \frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}},\,\dots,\,\frac{ x_{n} }{ x_{1} } \right)=f(x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}) {}$. Therefore, $g\left( \frac{1}{x_{1}} ,\, \frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}},\,\dots,\,\frac{ x_{n} }{ x_{1} } \right) {}$ is a polynomial ${} \in K[x_{1},\,\dots,\,x_{n}] {}$. This is only possible if $g$ is constant. This implies that ${} F {}$ is constant. 
## Remark on Topology
### Proposition 1.6:
Let $X,\, Y {}$ be projective algebraic sets, and let ${} f:X\to{}Y {}$. Then $f$ is continuous on the Zariski topology. 
### Corollary 1.7:
If ${} X,\, Y \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K} {}$ are curves, and $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is a non-constant morphism, then $f$ is finite-to-one. 

If $K=\mathbb{C} {}$ then topologically, then ${} X,\, Y \cong  {}$ genus $g$ curves. Usually, a map from a genus $g$ to genus $h$ curve is extremely complicated. In fact, it usually contracts positive dimensional subsets. From a topological standpoint, morphisms of algebraic sets are very special.
