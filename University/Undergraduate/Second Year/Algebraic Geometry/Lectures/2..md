### 
We've learned about the geometry of solutions to *one* polynomial. What about systems of equations of the form
$$
\begin{align}
 f(x,\, y) & =0   \\
 g(x,\, y) & =0
 \end{align}
$$
### Definition 1.1: Projective Space (general)
Let ${} K {}$ be a field. Then
$$
\begin{align}
 \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} & =\{ \text{lines through the origin in } K^{n+1} \}  \\
 & = \{  \text{ratios of the form }[X_{0}:X_{1}:\dots :X_{n}],\, X_{i} \in K \} \\
 & =(K^{n+1} - \{ 0 \}) /\sim \qquad (X_{0},\, X_{1},\,\dots,\,X_{n})\sim (tX_{0},\, tX_{1},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})
 \end{align}
$$

As in ${} \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{C} {}$, we have homogenous coordinates on ${} \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} {}$, namely
$$
[X_{0}:X_{1}:\dots :X_{n}]
$$
### Proposition 1.2:
Define ${} U_{i} \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} {}$ to be the following:
$$
U_{i}=\{ [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] \mid  X_{i} \neq 0 \}
$$
1. We have a "natural" identification ${} U_{i}\to{}K^{n} {}$ given by ${} [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n} ]\mapsto (X_{0} /X_{i},\,\dots,\,\hat{X_{i}},\,\dots,\,X_{n} / X_{i}) {}$. 
2. ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K}=\bigcup_{i=0}^{n} U_{i} {}$ (note this is not necessarily disjoint)
If you know about manifolds, this shows that ${} P^{n}_{\mathbb{R}}$ or ${} P^{n}_{\mathbb{C}} {}$ is a manifold, and the ${} U_{i}$ are open subsets of the manifold. 

3. on ${} U_{i}\cong K^{n} {}$ we have affine (Euclidian, cartesian, etc) coordinates
$$
x_{j}=\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}}
$$
where ${} j\neq i$. These are the natural coordinate functions on ${} K^{n} {}$. Now if $i\neq j {}$, then 
$$
U_{j}\supseteq U_{i} \cap  U_{j} =\left\{  x_{i}=\frac{X_{i}}{X_{0}} \neq 0   \right\} \subseteq K^{n}
$$
4. We have a natural identification of ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K} -\{ U_{i} \}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{K} {}$ given by 
$$
[X_{0}:\dots :0:\dots :X_{n}]\mapsto [X_{0}:\dots :X_{i-1}:X_{i+1}:\dots :X_{n}]
$$
#### Proof:
Exercise #todo 

Let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$. We call $f {}$ homogenous of degree $d {}$ iff ${} f(tX_{0},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})=t^{d}f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}) {}$. 
### Lemma 1.3:
Let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ be a homogenous polynomial. Then $f$ does not define a well-defined function 
$$
\mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} \to{}K
$$
unless $f {}$ is constant. 

However, 
$$
\{ [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] \mid  f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0 \} \subseteq  \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n}
$$
is well defined. 
#### Proof:
If $f$ defines a well-defined function on ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K}$, then it must assign the same value to ${} [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] {}$ and ${} [tX_{0}:\dots tX_{n}] {}$, as these represent the same point in ${} \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n}$. However, 
$$
f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0 \iff f(tX_{0},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})=t^{d}f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0
$$
### Proposition 1.4:
Let ${} K$ be a field, and let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\, X_{1}] {}$ be a degree $d$ homogenous polynomial. Then 
1. ${} \aleph (\{ [X_{0}:X_{1}] \in \mathbb{P}^{1}_{K} \mid  f(X_{0},\, X_{1})=0 \})\leq d {}$
2. If $K$ is algebraically closed, then (counted with multiplicity)
$$
{} \aleph (\{ [X_{0}:X_{1}] \in \mathbb{P}^{1}_{K} \mid  f(X_{0},\, X_{1})=0 \})= d {}
$$
#### Proof:
Let ${} \conj{K} {}$ be an algebraic closure of $K$. The inclusion ${} K \subseteq \conj{K} {}$ gives an inclusion ${} \mathbb{P}^{1}_{K} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{1}_{\conj{K}} {}$ and so ${} 2 \to{}1 {}$. So we may assume $K {}$ algebraically closed. 

 We may write 
$$
f(X_{0},\, X_{1})=X_{1}^{e} g(X_{0},\, X_{1})
$$
where $g$ is homogenous of degree ${} d-e {}$ and ${} X_{1} \nmid g(X_{0},\, X_{1}) {}$. Let ${} t=X_{0} / X_{1} {}$, and recall that ${} X_{1}^{d}f(t,\, 1)=f(X_{0},\, X_{1}) {}$. We define ${} h(t)=g(t,\, 1) {}$. Now since $K$ is algebraically closed, then 
$$
h(t)=(t-\alpha_{1})^{n_{1}}\dots (t-\alpha_{r})^{n_{r}}
$$
for roots ${} \alpha_{i} \in K {}$, and ${} n_{1}+\dots+n_{r}=d-e {}$. Multiplying by ${} X_{1}^{d}$ gives
$$
f(X_{0},\, X_{1})=(X_{0}-\alpha_{1}X_{1})^{n_{1}}\dots (X_{0}-\alpha_{r}X_{r})^{n_{r}} X_{1}^{e}
$$
and so $f {}$ has zeros at ${} [\alpha_{i}:1] {}$ of multiplicity ${} n_{i}$, and zeros at ${} [1,\, 0] {}$ of multiplicity $e$. We conclude by observing that ${} n_{1}+\dots+n_{r}+e=d {}$. 
### Theorem 1.5: BÃ©zout's Theorem 
Let ${} K$ be an algebraically closed field, and let 
$$
C_{i} \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}
$$
be a "curve" defined as ${} C_{i}=\{ f_{i}=0 \} {}$ where ${} f_{i}$ is homogenous of degree ${} d_{i}$, for ${} i=1,\, 2 {}$. Assume that $f_{1}\neq f_{2} {}$. Then the the number of intersection points of ${} C_{1} {}$ with $C_{2} {}$ is ${} d_{1},\, d_{2} {}$, when counted with multiplicity. 
#### Proof:
Too hard to prove in general  (:() but we move. We'll prove it in special cases. 

We say that a curve in ${} \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K}$ is a *line* if is the zero set of a degree $1$ homogenous polynomial. Then
### Theorem
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field. Then $f$ is homogenous of degree $d$, and let $C$ be it's zero set in ${} \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K} {}$, and let ${} L \subseteq \mathbb{P}^{2}_{K} {}$ be a line. Then the number of intersections of $C$ and $L$ is $d$, counted with multiplicity. 
#### Proof:
Since ${} C \cap  L {}$ is invariant under change of coordinates, we may assume that ${} L=\{ X=0 \} {}$. Our intersection is now given by
$$
\{ [X:Y:Z] \mid  f(X,\, Y,\, Z)=X=0 \}
$$
Because $L \neq C {}$, we have that ${} X \nmid  f(X,\, Y,\, Z) {}$ (result of nullstellensatz (cheating)). In particular, if ${} g(Y,\, X)=f(0,\, Y,\, Z) {}$, then $g$ is a homogenous polynomial of degree $d$. By prop 1.4, the number of solutions to $g$ is $d$, counted with multiplicity.
