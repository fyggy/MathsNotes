### 
We've learned about the geometry of solutions to *one* polynomial. What about systems of equations of the form
$$
\begin{align}
 f(x,\, y) & =0   \\
 g(x,\, y) & =0
 \end{align}
$$

Let $K {}$ be a field. Then
$$
\begin{align}
 \mathbb{P}_{n}^{K} & =\{ \text{lines through the origin in } K^{n+1} \}  \\
 & = \{  \text{ratios of the form }[X_{0}:X_{1}:\dots :X] \}
 \end{align}

$$
