### 
We've learned about the geometry of solutions to *one* polynomial. What about systems of equations of the form
$$
\begin{align}
 f(x,\, y) & =0   \\
 g(x,\, y) & =0
 \end{align}
$$
### Definition 1.1: Projective Space (general)
Let ${} K {}$ be a field. Then
$$
\begin{align}
 \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} & =\{ \text{lines through the origin in } K^{n+1} \}  \\
 & = \{  \text{ratios of the form }[X_{0}:X_{1}:\dots :X_{n}],\, X_{i} \in K \} \\
 & =(K^{n+1} - \{ 0 \}) /\sim \qquad (X_{0},\, X_{1},\,\dots,\,X_{n})\sim (tX_{0},\, tX_{1},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})
 \end{align}
$$

As in ${} \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{C} {}$, we have homogenous coordinates on ${} \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} {}$, namely
$$
[X_{0}:X_{1}:\dots :X_{n}]
$$
### Proposition 1.2:
Define ${} U_{i} \subseteq \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} {}$ to be the following:
$$
U_{i}=\{ [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] \mid  X_{i} \neq 0 \}
$$
1. We have a "natural" identification ${} U_{i}\to{}K^{n} {}$ given by ${} [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n} ]\mapsto (X_{0} /X_{i},\,\dots,\,\hat{X_{i}},\,\dots,\,X_{n} / X_{i}) {}$. 
2. ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K}=\bigcup_{i=0}^{n} U_{i} {}$ (note this is not necessarily disjoint)
If you know about manifolds, this shows that ${} P^{n}_{\mathbb{R}}$ or ${} P^{n}_{\mathbb{C}} {}$ is a manifold, and the ${} U_{i}$ are open subsets of the manifold. 

3. on ${} U_{i}\cong K^{n} {}$ we have affine (Euclidian, cartesian, etc) coordinates
$$
x_{j}=\frac{X_{j}}{X_{i}}
$$
where ${} j\neq i$. These are the natural coordinate functions on ${} K^{n} {}$. Now if $i\neq j {}$, then 
$$
U_{j}\supseteq U_{i} \cap  U_{j} =\left\{  x_{i}=\frac{X_{i}}{X_{0}} \neq 0   \right\} \subseteq K^{n}
$$
4. We have a natural identification of ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K} -\{ U_{i} \}\to{}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{K} {}$ given by 
$$
[X_{0}:\dots :0:\dots :X_{n}]\mapsto [X_{0}:\dots :X_{i-1}:X_{i+1}:\dots :X_{n}]
$$
#### Proof:
Exercise #todo 

Let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$. We call $f {}$ homogenous of degree $d {}$ iff ${} f(tX_{0},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})=t^{d}f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}) {}$. 
### Lemma 1.3:
Let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n}] {}$ be a homogenous polynomial. Then $f$ does not define a well-defined function 
$$
\mathbb{P}_{K}^{n} \to{}K
$$
unless $f {}$ is constant. 

However, 
$$
\{ [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] \mid  f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0 \} \subseteq  \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n}
$$
is well defined. 
#### Proof:
If $f$ defines a well-defined function on ${} \mathbb{P}^{n}_{K}$, then it must assign the same value to ${} [X_{0}:\dots :X_{n}] {}$ and ${} [tX_{0}:\dots tX_{n}] {}$, as these represent the same point in ${} \mathbb{P}_{K}^{n}$. However, 
$$
f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0 \iff f(tX_{0},\,\dots,\,tX_{n})=t^{d}f(X_{0},\,\dots,\,X_{n})=0
$$
### Proposition 1.4:
Let $K$ be a field, and let ${} f \in K[X_{0},\, X_{1}] {}$ be a degree $d$ homogenous polynomial. Then 
1. ${} \aleph (\{ [X_{0}:X_{1}] \in \mathbb{P}^{1}_{K} \mid  f(X_{0},\, X_{1})=0 \})\leq d {}$
2. If $K$ is algebraically closed, then (counted with muiltiplicity)
