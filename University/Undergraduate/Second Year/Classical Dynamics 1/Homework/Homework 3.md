1. 
The kinetic energy of this particle is
$$
E_{k}=\frac{m}{2} \mathbf{\dot{r}} \cdot \mathbf{\dot{r}}
$$
and it's potential energy is simply ${} V(\mathbf{r}) {}$. Then the total energy has
$$
\begin{align}
 \frac{dE}{dt}  & =m \ddot{\mathbf{r}}\cdot {\dot{\mathbf{r}}}+\frac{d}{dt} V(\mathbf{r}(t))   \\
 & =
 \end{align}

$$
