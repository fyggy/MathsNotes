# Newtons Laws
## 
###
N1: A particle will stay at rest or move with a constant velocity (along a straight) line unless acted on by an external force. 
- This is equivalent to the existence of "inertial frames" where N1 holds
- a *particle* is an object whose internal size, shape, etc, does not affect it's dynamics
- *velocity* is a vector (and speed is it's magnitude)

N2: The rate of change of the momentum of a particle is equal to and in the opposite direction of the net force acting on it, that is, 
$$
F=ma
$$
or
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{p}=\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}
$$
as ${} \mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{v} {}$, and so ${} \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{p}=m \frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{v}=m\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}} {}$.

N3: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction:![[Pasted image 20241003162524.png]]
The first law, N1, establishes the existence of inertial frames, which are special choices of coordinates. These frames are related by three types of transformation:
1) Translations: ${} \mathbf{r} \to{}\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{a} {}$. 
2) Rotations: ${} \mathbf{r} \to{}O\mathbf{r} {}$, where $O$ is an orthogonal matrix
3) Boots: ${} \mathbf{r}\to{}\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{v}t {}$
These are called Galilean symmetries. Note that boosts are not truly a symmetry in reality, thanks to fucking Einstein. 
## Application of Newton's Laws
### Example: The Skier
![[Pasted image 20241003163630.png]]
1) Figure out all the forces, and write them down. 
2) Resolve the forces and add them up. 

We pick coordinates such that $x$ is running along the slope, and $y {}$ is perpendicular to the slope. Then we have that
$$
\mathbf{F}_{R}=\lVert \mathbf{F}_{R} \rVert \hat{y}+0\hat{x}
$$
Now consider
![[Pasted image 20241003163918.png]]
and so 
$$
\mathbf{F}_{g}=-mg\sin (\theta) \hat{x}-mg \cos  (\theta) \hat{y}
$$
and so
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}} & =\mathbf{F}_{R}+\mathbf{F}_{g} \\
  & =-mg \sin(\theta)\hat{x}+(\lVert \mathbf{F}_{R} \rVert -mg\cos (\theta))\hat{y} \\
\mathbf{a} & =-\lVert \mathbf{a} \rVert \hat{x}+0\hat{y}
\end{align}
$$
so
$$
\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=m\mathbf{a}\Rightarrow -m \lVert \mathbf{a} \rVert =-mg\sin \theta
$$
and 
$$
\Rightarrow \lVert \mathbf{F}_{R} \rVert -mg\cos \theta=0
$$
so
$$
\begin{align}
 -m \lVert \mathbf{a} \rVert & =-mg\sin \theta   \\
 m \ddot{x} & =-mg \sin \theta \\
 m \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}  & =-mg \sin \theta \\
 \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}  & =-g\sin \theta  
 \end{align}
$$
