#### Example:
Consider the graph consisting of $n {}$ edges (only 4 pictured)
![[Pasted image 20241125142131.png]]
Then the homology complex looks like
$$
0 \to{} \mathbb{Z}^{n} \to{} \mathbb{Z} \to{} 0
$$
and ${} e_{1}= v-v=0 {}$, and so
$$
\begin{align}
H_{0}  & =\mathbb{Z} \\
H_{1} & =\mathbb{Z}^{n}
\end{align}
$$
This makes sense, as every path is a loop

Now consider 
![[Pasted image 20241125142442.png]]
This has the chain complex
$$
0 \to{} \mathbb{Z}^{2} \to{d_{i}} \mathbb{Z}^{3} \to{}0
$$
It is easy to show that ${} H_{0}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} {}$. 
## Snake Lemma
We are working in $R$-modules, where $R$ is a commutative ring. 
Suppose we have a diagram
![[Pasted image 20241125150659.png]]
whose squares commute, and the rows are exact.
### Proposition 1.1:
In the diagram above, 
$$
\begin{align}
{} f_{1}(\ker d_{A})  & \subseteq \ker d_{B} {} \\
{} g_{1}(\ker d_{b})  & \subseteq \ker d_{c} {}
\end{align}
$$
and
$$
0 \to{} \ker d_{A} \to{} \ker d_{B} \to{} \ker d_{C}
$$
is exact. That is, the rows of the below diagram are exact
![[Pasted image 20241125143548.png]]
#### Proof:
We have that if ${} a \in \ker d_{A} {}$, then ${} 0=f_{0}(d_{A}(a))=d_{B}(f_{1}(a)) {}$ and so ${} f_{1}(a) \in \ker d_{B} {}$. Likewise, ${} g_{1}(b) \in \ker d_{C} {}$

Now $f_{1}$ is injective, so the map restricted to ${} \ker d_{A} {}$ is still injective, and the arrow ${} \ker d_{A} \to{}\ker d_{B} {}$ is injective. 

Now we want to show that ${} \ker  g_{1, *}=\im  f_{1,*} {}$. If we have ${} a \in \ker d_{A} {}$, then ${} a \in A_{1} {}$, and so ${} f_{1}(a) \in \ker g_{1} {}$, and so ${}  {}$

Suppose that ${} a \in \im  f_{1,*} {}$. Then we have that ${} a \in \im f_{1} =\ker g_{1} {}$, and so commutativity tells us that ${} g_{1,*}(a)=g_{1}(a)=0 {}$, and ${} a \in \ker g_{1,*} {}$. 

Now if ${} b \in \ker g_{1,\, *} {}$, then ${} b \in  \im f_{1} {}$, and so ${} b=f_{1}(a) {}$ for ${} a \in A_{1} {}$. Now since ${} b \in \ker d_{B} {}$, then ${} d_{B}(b)=d_{B}(f_{1}(a))=f_{0}(d_{A}(a))=0 {}$, and since $f_{0}$ is injective, then ${} d_{A}(a)=0 {}$, and ${} a \in \ker d_{A} {}$ with ${} f_{1,*}(a)=f_{1}(a)=b {}$. Therefore, ${} b \in \im f_{1,*} {}$. Therefore the top row is exact at ${} \ker d_{B} {}$, and the top row is exact
### Definition 1.2: Cokernels
The cokernel of a map ${} M\to{f} N {}$ is defined by ${} N / \im f {}$. The cokernel satisfies the following universal property
![[Pasted image 20241125151322.png]]
The above diagram commutes, and the top row is exact. (Note that is is the dual of the factorisation theorem (I think, check this #todo)).

Now on our diagram we may add the cokernels:
![[Pasted image 20241125152001.png]]
Exercise: #todo show that the bottom row is exact.
We also have that the columns are complexes, clearly. 
### Definition 1.3
In the diagram above with the conditions given, we have a map ${} \delta:\ker d_{C} \to{}\coker d_{A} {}$:
![[Pasted image 20241125152203.png]]
 Given by:
 ![[Pasted image 20241125152827.png]]
 and we map
 $$
\delta(c)=a+\im d_{A}
$$
Suppose that ${} b,b' \mapsto c {}$. Then ${} b-b' \in \ker g_{1}=\im f_{1} {}$, and so we have ${} \tilde{a}\mapsto b-b' {}$
![[Pasted image 20241125153017.png]]
Now suppose that ${} a' \mapsto d_{B}(b') {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
(d_{B} \circ f_{1})(\tilde{a})=(f_{0} \circ  d_{A})(\tilde{a})=d_{B}(b)-d_{B}(b')=f_{0}(a-a')
\end{align}
$$
now since $f_{0}$ is exact, then ${} d_{A}(\tilde{a})=a-a' {}$, and so ${} a-a' \in \im d_{A} {}$, and
![[Pasted image 20241125154211.png]]
$\delta$ is well defined, as ${} a+\im d_{A}=a'+\im d_{B} {}$. 

### Lemma 1.4:
In the diagram above, the sequence
$$
0 \to{} \ker d_{A} \to{}\ker d_{B} \to{}\ker d_{C} \to{\delta}\coker d_{A} \to{}\coker d_{B} \to{}\coker d_{C} \to{}0
$$
is exact. 
#### Proof:
Suppose that ${} c=g_{1,*}(b) {}$, then ${} b \in \ker d_{B} {}$. Then ${} d_{B}(b)=0 {}$, and since $f_{0}$ is injective, then ${} a=0 {}$. Therefore, ${} \delta(g_{1,*}(b))=0+\im d_{A} {}$. Therefore, it is a complex on the left. 

Now we show exactness. Suppose that ${} c \in \ker (\delta) {}$. Therefore, the $a$ we find has ${} a \in  \im d_{A} {}$, and we have ${} \tilde{a} {}$ with ${} d_{A}(\tilde{a})=a {}$. Set ${} \tilde{b}=f_{1}(\tilde{a}) {}$. Therefore, ${} g_{1}(\tilde{b})=0 {}$.
