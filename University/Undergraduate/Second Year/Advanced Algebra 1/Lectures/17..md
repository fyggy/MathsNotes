#### Example:
Consider the graph consisting of $n {}$ edges (only 4 pictured)
![[Pasted image 20241125142131.png]]
Then the homology complex looks like
$$
0 \to{} \mathbb{Z}^{n} \to{} \mathbb{Z} \to{} 0
$$
and ${} e_{1}= v-v=0 {}$, and so
$$
\begin{align}
H_{0}  & =\mathbb{Z} \\
H_{1} & =\mathbb{Z}^{n}
\end{align}
$$
This makes sense, as every path is a loop

Now consider 
![[Pasted image 20241125142442.png]]
This has the chain complex
$$
0 \to{} \mathbb{Z}^{2} \to{d_{i}} \mathbb{Z}^{3} \to{}0
$$
It is easy to show that ${} H_{0}=\mathbb{Z}^{2} {}$. 
## Snake Lemma
We are working in $R$-modules, where $R$ is a commutative ring. 
Suppose we have a diagram
![[Pasted image 20241125143207.png]]
whose squares commute, and the rows are exact.
### Proposition 1.1:
In the diagram above, 
$$
\begin{align}
{} f_{1}(\ker d_{A})  & \subseteq \ker d_{B} {} \\
{} g_{1}(\ker d_{b})  & \subseteq \ker d_{c} {}
\end{align}
$$
and
$$
0 \to{} \ker d_{A} \to{} \ker d_{B} \to{} \ker d_{C}
$$
is exact. That is, the rows of the below diagram are exact
![[Pasted image 20241125143548.png]]
#### Proof:
We have that if ${} a \in \ker d_{A} {}$, then ${} 0=f_{0}(d_{A}(a))=d_{B}(f_{1}(a)) {}$ and so ${} f_{1}(a) \in \ker d_{B} {}$. Likewise, ${} g_{1}(b) \in \ker d_{C} {}$

Now $f_{1}$ is injective, so the map restricted to ${} \ker d_{A} {}$ is still injective, and the arrow ${} \ker d_{A} \to{}\ker d_{B} {}$ is injective. 

Now we want to show that ${} \ker  g_{1, *}=\im  f_{1,*} {}$. If we have ${} a \in \ker d_{A} {}$, then ${} a \in A_{1} {}$, and so ${} f_{1}(a) \in \ker g_{1} {}$, and so ${}  {}$

Suppose that ${} b \in \ker d_{B} {}$. Then exactness tells us that ${} b \in \im f_{1} {}$
