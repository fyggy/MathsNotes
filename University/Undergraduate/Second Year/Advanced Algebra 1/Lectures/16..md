# Homology
## Homology of Graphs 
We consider specifically directed graphs. 
### Definition 1.1:
A directed graph consists of a pair of sets $V$ and $E$, the sets of vertices and edges. It also has a function ${} \vec{t}:E\to{}V\times V {}$ mapping
$$
e \mapsto  (t_{0}(e),\, t_{1}(e))
$$

The chain complex of $\mathbb{Z} {}$-modules associated to ${} (V,\, E,\, \vec{t}) {}$ is given by
$$
M_{0}=F_{V}=\text{the free }\mathbb{Z} \text{ module on the vertices }V=\bigoplus_{v \in V} \mathbb{Z}v
$$
and
$$
M_{1}=F_{E}=\bigoplus_{e \in E}\mathbb{Z}e
$$
and ${} M_{i}=0 {}$ for all other ${} i\neq 0,\, 1 {}$. Finally, define $f:M_{1}\to{}M_{0} {}$ by
$$
f(e)=t_{1}(e)-t_{0}(e)
$$
$$
\dots \to{}0\to{}M_{1}\to{f}M_{0}\to{}0\to{}\dots 
$$
This is clearly a chain complex. Now we have
$$
\begin{align}
Z_{0}=M_{0}
\end{align}
$$
