# Categories
## Morphism Types
#### Example:
If ${} G$ is any group, we can construct a category from $G$ as follows:
- ${} \Ob (\mathscr{C})=\{ \bullet \} {}$
- ${} \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)=G {}$
- ${} \circ :\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)\times \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)\to{}\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet) {}$ is defined by ${} (g_{1},\, g_{2})\mapsto g_{1}g_{2} {}$.
This is a category, as
$$
1\circ g=1g=g
$$
and
$$
g \circ  1=g1=g
$$
and thanks to associative, we have
$$
a \circ (b\circ c)
=a \circ (bc)=a(bc)=(ab)c=(a b) \circ c=(a \circ  b) \circ  c
$$
### Definition 1.1: Isomorphism
Let $\mathscr{C} {}$ be a category and a morphism ${} A \to{f}B {}$. We say that $f$ is an *isomorphism* iff $f$ has an *inverse*, i.e. there exists some $g:B\to{}A {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
g \circ f & =\id _{A} \quad \text{ and}\\
 f \circ g  & = \id _{B}
\end{align}
$$
#### Example:
In $\mathbf{Set}  {}$, we have that $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is an isomorphism exactly when $f$ is a bijection. 
#### Example:
In $\mathbf{Grp} {}$, we have that $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is an isomorphism exactly when $f {}$ is an isomorphism.
### Definition 1.2:
Let ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ be a category and a morphism ${} A \to{f}A {}$. We say that $f$ is an *automorphism* if it has an inverse, i.e. there exists some ${} g :B\to{}A {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
g \circ  f  & = \id _{A}\quad \text{ and} \\
 f \circ g & =\id _{A}
\end{align}
$$
And that ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ denote the set of automorphisms of $A$.
### Proposition 1.3:
Given any object ${} A \in \Ob (\mathscr{C}) {}$ for some category $\mathscr{C} {}$, ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ is a group under composition.
#### Proof:
We want to show that if ${} f,\, g \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$, then ${} f \circ g \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$.

By assumption, $f$ and $g$ are isomorphisms. So, there exists some ${} f',\, g' \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
f \circ f'=f'\circ f & =\id _{A} \\
 g \circ  g'=g' \circ  g & =\id_{A}
\end{align}
$$
and so
$$
\begin{align}
 (f' \circ  g') \circ ( g\circ f)  & =f' \circ (g' \circ  g)\circ f \\
  & =f' \circ  \id _{A} \circ  f \\
  & =f' \circ  f \\
  & =\id_{A} 
 \end{align}
$$
similarly
$$
\begin{align}
(g \circ f) \circ (f' \circ  g') & =\id_{A}
\end{align}
$$
that is, ${} f' \circ g'=(g \circ  f)^{-1} {}$, and so ${} g \circ  f \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$.
Now it is clear to see that 
- ${} \id _A {}$ is the identity, 
- since ${} f \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$, then $f$ has an inverse
- since $\circ$ is associative, then ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ is a group under $\circ {}$
#### Example:
If ${} X$ is a set, then ${} \aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X)=S_{X} {}$.
#### Example:
If ${} G {}$ is a group, then ${} \aut_{\mathbf{Grp} }(G)=\aut(G) {}$.
#### Example:
If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then ${} \aut_{F\mathbf{-vec}}(V)=\mathrm{GL}(V) {}$
## Group Actions
### Remark:
Let ${} G \times X \to{}X {}$ be the action of a group ${} G$ on a set $X$. From this data, we obtain for all ${} g \in G {}$ a map 
$$
\begin{align}
 \varphi_{g}:X & \to{}X   \\
 x & \mapsto g\cdot x
 \end{align}
$$
This is bijective, i.e. ${} \varphi_{g} \in \aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X) {}$. Now we consider
$$
\begin{align}
\Phi:G & \to{}\aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X) \\
  g &  \mapsto (\varphi_{g}:X\to{}X)
\end{align}
$$
We claim that this is actually a group homomorphism, in particular, ${} \Phi(gh)=\Phi(g)\Phi(h) {}$, and so we want to show that
$$
\Phi(gh)=\varphi_{gh}=\varphi_{g} \circ  \varphi_{h}=\Phi(g) \Phi(h)
$$
Let ${} x \in X {}$. Now
$$
\varphi_{gh}(x)=(gh) \cdot x=g\cdot (h\cdot x)=\varphi_{g}(\varphi_{h}(x))=(\varphi_{g}\circ \varphi_{h})(x)
$$
So $\Phi$ is a group homomorphism.

The reverse is also true: given a group homomorphism ${} \Phi:G\to{}\aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X) {}$, we obtain an action 
$$
\begin{align}
G \times  X  & \to{}X \\
 (g,\, x)  & \mapsto \varphi_{g}(x)
\end{align}
$$
In other words, group actions on a set $X$ are exactly the same as a group homomorphism ${} G \to{}\aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X) {}$
### Definition 2.1:
Let $G$ be a group, and let ${} A \in \Ob( \mathscr{C}) {}$, then an action of $G$ on $A$ (in the category $\mathscr{C} {}$) is a choice of group homomorphism
$$
f:G\to{}\aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A)
$$
#### Example:
Let ${} \mathscr{C}=\mathbf{Set}  {}$. Recall that 
$$
\aut_{\mathbb{R}\mathbf{-vec}}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=\mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R})
$$
an action of $G$ on ${} \mathbb{R}^{n} {}$ as an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space is a group homomorphism ${} f:G\to{}\aut_{\mathbb{R}-\mathbf{vec}}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=\mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R}) {}$. This is called a representation. 
#### Example:
If $G$ is a group, we have ${} f:G\to{}\aut_{\mathbf{Grp} }(G) {}$ mapping ${} g \mapsto (h\mapsto ghg^{-1}) {}$, that is, conjugation.
# Free Groups and Presentations
## Construction
Let $S$ be a set. We want to construct the largest group generated by a set $S$. 
### Definition 2.1:
Let $S^{+}$ and ${} S^{-}$ both be copies of $S {}$. Given an element ${} s \in S {}$, denote the corresponding element of ${} S^{+}$ by $s$ and ${} S^{-}$ by $s^{-1} {}$.
#### Example:
If ${} S=\{ x,\, y \} {}$, then ${} S^{+}=\{ x,\, y \} {}$ and ${} S^{-}=\{ x^{-1},\, y^{-1} \} {}$.
### Definition 2.2: Reduced Words
A *reduced word* in ${} S {}$ is a sequence of finite length ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$ 
$$
(t_{1},\,\dots,\,t_{n})
$$
with 
- ${} t_{i} \in S^{+} \cup S^{-} {}$ for all ${} 1\leq {} i\leq n {}$
- ${} t_{i+1} {}$ is never the inverse of ${} t_{i}$.
