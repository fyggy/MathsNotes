# Categories
## 
#### Example:
If $G$ is any group, we can construct a category from $G$ as follows:
- ${} \Ob (\mathscr{C})=\{ \bullet \} {}$
- ${} \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)=G {}$
- ${} \circ :\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)\times \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet)\to{}\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\bullet,\, \bullet) {}$ is defined by ${} (g_{1},\, g_{2})\mapsto g_{1}g_{2} {}$.
This is a category, as
$$
1\circ g=1g=g
$$
and
$$
g \circ  1=g1=g
$$
and thanks to associative, we have
$$
a \circ (b\circ c)
=a \circ (bc)=a(bc)=(ab)c=(a b) \circ c=(a \circ  b) \circ  c
$$
### Definition 1.1: Isomorphism
Let $\mathscr{C} {}$ be a catagory and a morphism ${} A \to{f}B {}$. We say that $f$ is an *isomorphism* iff $f$ has an *inverse*, i.e. there exists some $g:B\to{}A {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
g \circ f & =\id _{A} \quad \text{ and}\\
 f \circ g  & = \id _{B}
\end{align}
$$
#### Example:
In $\mathbf{Set}  {}$, we have that $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is an isomorphism exactly when $f$ is a bijection. 
#### Example:
In $\mathbf{Grp} {}$, we have that $f:X\to{}Y {}$ is an isomorphism exactly when $f$ is an isomorphism.
### Definition 1.2:
Let ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ be a category and a morphism ${} A \to{f}A {}$. We say that $f$ is an *automorphism* if it has an inverse, i.e. there exists some ${} g :B\to{}A {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
g \circ  f  & = \id _{A}\quad \text{ and} \\
 f \circ g & =\id _{A}
\end{align}
$$
And that ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ denote the set of automorphisms of $A$.
### Proposition 1.3:
Given any object ${} A \in \Ob (\mathscr{C}) {}$ for some category $\mathscr{C} {}$, ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ is a group under composition.
#### Proof:
We want to show that if ${} f,\, g \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$, then ${} f \circ g \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$.

By assumption, $f$ and $g$ are isomorphisms. So, there exists some ${} f',\, g' \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
f \circ f'=f'\circ f & =\id _{A} \\
 g \circ  g'=g' \circ  g & =\id_{A}
\end{align}
$$
and so
$$
\begin{align}
 (f' \circ  g') \circ ( g\circ f)  & =f' \circ (g' \circ  g)\circ f \\
  & =f' \circ  \id _{A} \circ  f \\
  & =f' \circ  f \\
  & =\id_{A} 
 \end{align}
$$
similarly
$$
\begin{align}
(g \circ f) \circ (f' \circ  g') & =\id_{A}
\end{align}
$$
that is, ${} f' \circ g'=(g \circ  f)^{-1} {}$, and so ${} g \circ  f \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$.
Now it is clear to see that 
- ${} \id _A {}$ is the identity, 
- since ${} f \in \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$, then $f$ has an inverse
- since $\circ$ is associative, then ${} \aut_{\mathscr{C}}(A) {}$ is a group under $\circ {}$
#### Example:
If $X$ is a set, then ${} \aut_{\mathbf{Set} }(X)=S_{X} {}$.
#### Example:
If ${} G {}$ is a group, then ${} \aut_{\mathbf{Grp} }(G)=\aut(G) {}$.
#### Example:
If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then
