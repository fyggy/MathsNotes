### Claim
Suppose that ${} H \trianglelefteq G {}$. Then there is a well defined binary operation
$$
*: G/H \times  G /H \to{} G / H
$$
defined by
$$
(gH)*(kH)=(gk)H
$$
#### Proof:
Suppose ${} gH=g'H {}$ and ${} kH=k'H {}$, that is, ${} gg' \in H {}$ and ${} kk' \in H {}$. Now we want to show that
${} gkH=g'k'H {}$. Since ${} g^{-1}g' \in H {}$, then ${} k^{-1}g^{-1}g'k' \in H {}$ since $H {}$ is normal in $G {}$. Therefore, ${} gkH=g'k'H {}$. 

This gives ${} G /H {}$ a group structure under $* {}$.
the proof is an exercise #todo 

We write ${} [g] {}$ to mean $gH {}$ often. ${} G /H {}$ is called the *quotient* of $G {}$ by $H {}$
### Cyclic Groups
Recall that ${} \mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z}=\{ [0],\, [1],\, \dots,\, [n-1] \} {}$. It is easy to see that ${} [a]+[b]=[a+b] {}$
### Exercise: 
If $N \trianglelefteq \; G {}$, show that the subgroups of ${} G {}$ containing $N {}$ correspond to the subgroups of ${} G/ N {}$ (already done in DnF)
## Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms
### Definition 2.1: Homomorphism
Let ${} (G, *_{G}) {}$ and ${} (H,\, *_{H}) {}$ be groups. A map ${} f:G\to{}H {}$ is called a homomorphism iff
$$
f(x*_{G}y)=f(x)*_{H} f(y)
$$
#### Example:
${} G=H=\mathbb{R} {}$ under addition. Define ${} f(x)=2x {}$. Then $f {}$ is a group homomrphism.

Let ${} f:\mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R})\to{} \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R}) {}$ defined by ${} A \mapsto (A^{\mathrm{T}})^{-1} {}$ is a group homomorphism
### Definition 2.2: Monomorhisms, Epimorphisms, Isomorphisms
- A monomorphism is a injective homomorphism
- An epimorphism is a surjective homomorphism
- An isomorphism is a bijective homomorphism
### Exercise: 
If ${} \varphi: G\to{}H {}$ is a group homomorphism, and ${} S \subseteq  G {}$ is a generating subset of $G {}$, then ${} \varphi {}$ is uniquely determined by ${} \varphi_{|S} {}$.
#### Solution:
Let ${} x \in  G {}$. Then there exists a sequence of elements ${} \{ a_{i} \}_{i=1}^{n} {}$ with ${} a_{i} \in  S {}$such that ${} x=\prod_{i=1}^{n}a_{i} {}$. Now note that ${} \varphi(x)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\varphi(a_{i})  {}$, and that ${} \varphi(a_{i}) {}$ are all fixed. Therefore, there is only 1 value that ${} \varphi(x) {}$ may take, and so ${} \varphi {}$ is uniquely determined
### Definition 2.3: Kernel
Given a group homomorphism ${} f:G\to{}H {}$, we let 
$$
\im f=\{ f(x) \mid x \in G \}
$$
and 
$$
\ker f=\{ x \in  g \mid f(x)=1\}
$$
### Exercise: #todo 
Show that
$$
\begin{align}
 f \text{ is surjective}  & \iff \im (f)=H  \\
f \text{ is injective}  & \iff \ker (f)=1
 \end{align}
$$
Furthermore, show that ${} \ker f \trianglelefteq G {}$, and that ${} \im f \leq H {}$
#### Solution:
Suppose that $f {}$ is surjective. Then for every ${} h \in H {}$, there exists some ${} g \in G {}$ such that
