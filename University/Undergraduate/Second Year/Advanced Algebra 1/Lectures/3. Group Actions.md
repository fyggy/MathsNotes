### Example:
Consider 
$$
\mathbb{R} ^{\times } / \{ \pm1 \}
$$
We want a homomorphism ${} \mathbb{R} ^{\times } / \{  \pm 1 \}\to{}\mathbb{R}_{>0} {}$. Note that we already have a map ${} \mathbb{R}^{\times }\to{f}\mathbb{R}_{> 0} {}$ mapping ${} x\mapsto x^{2} {}$. Now by the first isomorphism theorem, we have 
$$
\mathbb{R}^{\times }\to{}\mathbb{R}^{\times } / \{ \pm 1 \} \to{} \mathbb{R_{>0}}
$$
since ${} \ker f=\{ \pm 1 \} {}$
Note, in this, we don't need ${} G /N {}$ to have ${} N = \ker f {}$, we only need ${} N \leq  \ker f {}$ (factor theorem).
# Group Actions
### Definition 1.1: Group Actions
Let $G {}$ be a group and $X {}$ be a set. Then an (left) *action* of ${} G {}$ on $X {}$, is a map of sets 
$$
\begin{align}
 \cdot :G \times  X &  \to{}X   \\
(g,\, x)  & \mapsto g \cdot x
 \end{align}
$$
such that 
1. ${} 1 \cdot x=x {}$
2. ${} g\cdot (h\cdot x)=(gh)\cdot x {}$
#### Example:
Let ${} G=S_{n} {}$, with ${} X=\{ 1,\,\dots,\,n \} {}$. Given ${} \sigma \in S_{n}=\{ \alpha \in X^{X} \mid  \alpha \text{ is a bijection} \} {}$, we set
$$
\sigma \cdot x=\sigma(x)
$$
We check that this is a group action. First, note that ${} 1 \in S_{n} {}$ is the identity, and so
$$
1 \cdot x=\id(x)=x
$$
Next, if ${} \sigma,\, \tau \in S_{n} {}$, then
$$
\begin{align}
\sigma\cdot (\tau\cdot x) & =\sigma\cdot (\tau(x)) \\
 & =\sigma(\tau (x))  \\
 & =(\sigma \circ \tau)(x) \\
 & =(\sigma\tau) \cdot x
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, ${} \cdot {}$ is a group action.
#### Example:
Any group $G$ acts on itself by left-multiplication. In particular, define
$$
g\cdot x=gx
$$
This is clearly an action. Right multiplication is *not* an action unless $G {}$ is abelian.

We also have an action 
$$
g \cdot x=gxg^{-1}
$$
This is $G$ acting on itself by *conjugation*.
### Definition 1.2: Orbits
Let ${} \cdot :G \times  X\to{}X {}$ be an action, then the *orbit* of $x$ under the action of $G$ on $X$, is defined to be the set
$$
\{ g \cdot x \mid  g \in G \}=G \cdot x
$$
### Notation:
An action of $G$ on $X$ is often denoted by $G {}$ (arrow going back round on itself look this up later  #todo)
### Lemma 1.3: 
Suppose that $G$ acts on $X$. Then the set of all orbits defines a partition of $X$ into disjoint subsets. 
#### Proof:
The orbits cover $X {}$, as ${} x \in G \cdot x {}$, and so for all $x$ there exists some orbit which contains it. 

Now suppose that ${} x \in G \cdot y {}$. for some ${} y \in X {}$, that is ${} x=h\cdot y {}$ for some ${} h \in G {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
 G \cdot x & =\{  g\cdot x \mid  g \in G \}   \\
 & =\{  g\cdot (h\cdot y) \mid  g \in G \} \\
 & =\{ (gh)\cdot y \mid g \in G \} \\
 & \subseteq \{  g \cdot y \mid  g \in G \}=G\cdot y
 \end{align}
$$
So ${} G \cdot x \subseteq G \cdot y {}$. Since ${} y=h^{-1} \cdot x {}$, then the reverse is true and ${} G \cdot x = G\cdot y {}$
#### Example:
Let ${} S_{n}  {}$ act on ${} \{ 1,\,\dots,\,n \}=X {}$. For any ${} i,j \in X {}$, there exists some ${} \sigma \in S_{n} {}$ with ${} \sigma \cdot i=j {}$  and ${} \sigma \cdot j =i {}$ and ${} \sigma \cdot k=k$ for all other ${} k \in X {}$. Therefore, ${} X= G \cdot j {}$ for any $j$, and there is only $1$ orbit. This action is then called *transitive*
#### Example:
We saw that ${} G$ acts on itself by conjugation. In this case, we call the orbits *conjugacy classes*:
$$
G \cdot h = \{ ghg^{-1} \mid  g \in G \}
$$
If ${} G=\mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C}) {}$, and if $A$ is a diagonal matrix with distinct eigenvalues ${} \{ \alpha_{1},\,\dots,\,\alpha_{n} \} {}$. Then the conjugacy class of $A$ is 
$$
\left\{   B \in  \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\mid  \text{ charactaristic polynomial of } B=\prod(x-\alpha_{i})  \right\}
$$
#### Exercise: #todo 
Show that $H \leq G {}$ is normal  iff $H {}$ is a union of conjugacy classes
### Definition 1.4: Stabilisers:
Let ${} G$ act on $X$. Fix ${} x \in X {}$. The stabiliser of $x {}$ under $G {}$ is 
$$
\mathrm{Stab}_{G}(x)=\{ g \in G \mid g \cdot x=x \}
$$
It is clear to see that ${} \stab _{G}(x) {}$ is a subgroup
#### Example:
Consider ${} S_{4}$ acting on ${} \{ 1,\,\dots,\,4 \} {}$. Then
$$
\stab _{S_{4}}(4)=\{ 1,\, (1\;2),\, (1\;3),\, (2\;\;3),\, (1\;2\;3),\, (1\;3\;2) \}
$$
Note that this is isomorphic to $S_{3} {}$
#### Example:
If ${} G$ acts on itself by conjugation, then ${} \stab _{G}(g) {}$ is called the centraliser of $G$, and is denoted ${} Z_{G}(g) {}$
### Proposition 1.5: Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem
Suppose that $G$ acts on $X$. Fix ${} x \in X {}$. Then there exists a canonical bijection of left cosets
$$
G / \stab _{G}(x)\to{f}G\cdot x
$$
mapping
$$
g\stab _{G}(x) \mapsto  g \cdot x
$$
#### Proof:
We first show that this is a well defined map. note that
$$
g \stab _{G}(x)=h \stab _{G}(x) \iff h^{-1}g \in \stab _{G}(x)
$$
and so ${} (h^{-1}g) \cdot x=x {}$ and ${} g\cdot x=h\cdot x {}$, and $f$ is well defined.

Actually, this also shows that $f$ is injective, as we may work backwards through the previous chain of logic. 

Finally, if ${} y \in G \cdot x {}$, so ${} y=g\cdot x {}$ for some ${} g \in G {}$. Now for this $g$, we have
$$
g \stab _{G}(x) \mapsto  g\cdot x=y
$$
and $f$ is bijective. 
### Corollary 1.6:
If $G$ acts on $X$, and ${} x \in X {}$, then
$$
[G:\stab _{G}(x)]=|(G \cdot x)|
$$
In particular if $G$ is finite, then the size of the orbits always divides the order of the group (even if $X$ is infinite)
### Exercise: #todo 
Suppose that $G$ acts on $X$, and that ${} g \in G {}$, and ${} x,\, y \in X {}$ such that ${} y=g\cdot x {}$. Then we have
that
$$
\stab _{G}(y)=g\stab _{G}(x)g^{-1}
$$
In fact, for all $H \leq G {}$, then $G {}$ acts on the left cosets ${} G /H {}$ by
$$
g \cdot (hH)=ghH
$$
Then ${} \stab _{G}(H)=H {}$
### Definition 1.7: Solubility
We say that a groip $G$ is solvable iff there exists a chain of subgroups
$$
1 =G_{0}\leq G_{1} \leq  \dots \leq G_{n}=G
$$
such that ${} G_{i-1}\trianglelefteq G_{i}$, and ${} G_{i} / G_{i-1} {}$ is abelian. 
#### Example:
We will show that $A_{5}$ is not solvable. Recall that ${} A_{5} \subseteq S_{5} {}$ is the set of the even permutations. 
##### Fact: to show #todo 
The conjugacy classes of $A_{5}$ are given by
![[Pasted image 20240930150916.png]]
Now we want to show that there does not exist a normal subgroup $N \trianglelefteq A_{5} {}$ with ${} N \neq 1 {}$. As we know that such an ${} N \trianglelefteq A_{5} {}$
- is a union of conjugacy classes
- has an order dividing ${} 60 {}$
This is impossible unless ${} N=1 {}$, as ${} 1 \in N {}$, so the order of ${} N=1+k {}$, where ${} k \mid  A_{5} {}$
# Categories and Actions
### Definition 2.1: Categories
A *category* ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ consists of:
- A class of *objects* of ${} \mathscr{C} {}$
- For any pair of objects ${} A,\, B {}$, a set of *morphisms* from ${} A {}$ to ${} B {}$ denoted ${} \hom_{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, B) {}$
- For any 3 objects ${} A,\, B,\, C \in \mathscr{C} {}$ a composition map 
$$
\circ :\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, B) \times  \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(B,\, C)\to{}\hom _{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, C)
$$
mapping
$$
(f,\, g)\mapsto g\circ f
$$
such that for any object of ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ there exists an identity map ${} \id _B \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(B,\, B) {}$ such that for any object $A$ of ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ and ${} f \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, B) {}$ we have
$$
\id _{B} \circ  f =f
$$
and similarly for all ${} g \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(B,\, A) {}$ we have
$$
g \circ  \id _{A}=g
$$

Furthermore, for all ${} A,\, B,\, C,\, D \in \mathscr{C} {}$ and ${} f \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, B),\, g \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(B,\, C),\, h \in  \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(C,\, D) {}$, then 
$$
h \circ (g \circ  f)=(h \circ  g)\circ  f
$$
#### Example:
Let ${} \mathbf{Set}=\mathscr{C} {}$ be the class of all sets. We define it as follows:
- The objects are sets
- ${} \hom _{\mathbf{Set}}(A,\, B)=\{ f:A\to{}B \mid f \text{ is a map of sets} \}) {}$
- Define composition to just be composition of maps. 
We show that this is a category. First, the identity morphism is just the identity map such that ${} f \circ  \id =f {}$ and ${} g \circ \id  =g {}$. Second, composition of functions is associative. Therefore, $\mathscr{C} {}$ is a category.
#### Example:
Let ${} \mathscr{C}=\mathbf{Grp} {}$, and we set
- Objects is the class of all groups
- ${} \hom _{\mathbf{Grp}}(A,\, B)=\{ f:A \to{}B \mid  f \text{ is a group homomorphism} \} {}$
- Composition is composition of maps
Similarly, ${} \mathbf{Ab}$ is the category of abelian groups.
#### Example:
Consider ${} \mathbf{\mathbb{R}-vec} {}$, and set
- Objects are the $\mathbb{R}$ vector spaces
- ${} \hom _{\mathbf{\mathbb{R}-vec}}(V,\, W)=\{ A:V\to{}W \mid  A\text{ is a linear map} \} {}$
- Composition of linear maps

We write $f:A\to{}B {}$ or ${} A \to{f}B {}$ for all elements of ${} f \in  \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(A,\, B) {}$, and we write that the collection of objects of ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ are denoted ${} \Ob(\mathscr{C}) {}$
#### Example:
Let ${} \mathscr{C} {}$ be a catagory with the following data:
- ${} \Ob (\mathscr{C})=\{ \nabla ,\, \square \} {}$
- Three morphisms:
	- ${} \id _{\nabla} \in  \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\nabla,\, \nabla) {}$
	- ${} \id _{\square}\in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\square,\, \square) {}$
	- ${} f \in \hom _{\mathscr{C}}(\nabla,\, \square) {}$
Note that the compositions are uniquely determined by the conditions on the composition.
