1. Let $G {}$ be a group and let ${} S \subseteq G {}$
a)
Let $\mathcal{A} {}$ be a non-empty set of subgroups of $G {}$. Set
$$
A=\bigcap_{H\in \mathcal{A}}H 
$$
Now let ${} x,\, y \in A {}$. Then ${} x,\, y \in H {}$ for all ${} H \in \mathcal{A} {}$. Since all the $H {}$ are subgroups, then ${} xy^{-1} \in H {}$, and therefore ${} xy^{-1} \in A {}$. Therefore, $A {}$ is a subgroup of $G {}$
b)
Let ${} \mathcal{A}_{S}=\{ H\leq G \mid S \subseteq H \} {}$, and set
$$
\langle S \rangle =\bigcap_{H\in \mathcal{A}_{S}} H 
$$
First note that since ${} S \subseteq H {}$ for all , then
