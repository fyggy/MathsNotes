# Preliminaries
## Brief Revision
### Bounded Sets
A set ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is said to be bounded above iff ${} \exists M \in\mathbb{R} {}$ such that ${} A \subseteq (-\infty,\,M] {}$
Similarly, ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is bounded below iff ${} \exists m \in \mathbb{R} {} {}$ such that ${} A \subseteq [m,\,\infty) {}$
If ${} A {}$ is bounded above and below, then $A {}$ is said to be *bounded*.
### Open and Closed sets
For ${} x \in\mathbb{R} {}$, a neighbourhood of ${} x {} {}$ is any open interval ${} (a,\,b) {}$ such that ${} x \in (a,\,b) {}$.
A point ${} x \in A {}$ is an *interior point* of $A {}$ if $A {}$ contains a neighbourhood of ${} x {}$.
${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is said to be open iff every ${} x \in A {}$ is an interior point of $A {}$, and closed iff the complement ${} \mathbb{R}\setminus A {}$ is open.
#### Example
For ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{R}:a<b {}$, then 
- ${} (a,\,b) {}$ is open
- ${} [a,\,b] {}$ is closed
- ${} [a,\,b) {}$ is neither
### Supremum and Infimum
Given ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$, a number ${} M \in\mathbb{R} {}$ is called a least upper bound or equivalently a supremum of $A {}$ iff 
- $M {}$ is an upper bound of $A {}$, and
- there is no other upper bound ${} M' {}$ for $A {}$ such that ${} M' < M {}$
#### Example
${} A=(a,\,b) {}$. Then ${} b+1 {}$ is an upper bound for $A {}$, but not it's supremum. The supremum is $b {}$.

Similarly, ${} m \in\mathbb{R} {}$ is a greatest lower bound, or infimum of $A {}$ if
- $m {}$ is a lower bound of $A {}$, and
- there is no other lower bound ${} m' {}$ for $A {}$ such that ${} m<m' {}$
#### Example
$$
A=\left\{\frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\right\},\, \qquad \mathbb{N}=\{ 1,\, 2,\, 3,\, \dots \}
$$
the infimum is 0
### Completeness
The completeness axiom for $\mathbb{R} {}$ asserts that
1. Every subset of ${} \mathbb{R} {}$ which is bounded above has a supremum. 
2. Every subset of $\mathbb{R} {}$ which is bounded below has a infimum
