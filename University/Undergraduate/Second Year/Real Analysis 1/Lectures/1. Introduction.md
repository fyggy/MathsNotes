# Real Analysis
## Opening remarks
### Stephen Lynch (weeks 1-4)

### Concepts
Continuity, differentiability, integration.


# Preliminaries
## Sets
### Bounded Sets
A set ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is said to be bounded above iff ${} \exists M \in\mathbb{R} {}$ such that ${} A \subseteq (-\infty,\,M] {}$
Similarly, ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is bounded below iff ${} \exists m \in \mathbb{R} {} {}$ such that ${} A \subseteq [m,\,\infty) {}$
If ${} A {}$ is bounded above and below, then $A {}$ is said to be *bounded*.
### Open and Closed sets
For ${} x \in\mathbb{R} {}$, a neighbourhood of ${} x {} {}$ is any open interval ${} (a,\,b) {}$ such that ${} x \in (a,\,b) {}$.
A point ${} x \in A {}$ is an *interior point* of $A {}$ if $A {}$ contains a neighbourhood of ${} x {}$.
${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is said to be open iff every ${} x \in A {}$ is an interior point of $A {}$, and closed iff the complement ${} \mathbb{R}\setminus A {}$ is open.
#### Example
For ${} a,\, b \in \mathbb{R}:a<b {}$, then 
- ${} (a,\,b) {}$ is open
- ${} [a,\,b] {}$ is closed
- ${} [a,\,b) {}$ is neither
### Supremum and Infimum
Given ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$, a number ${} M \in\mathbb{R} {}$ is called a least upper bound or equivalently a supremum of $A {}$ iff 
- $M {}$ is an upper bound of $A {}$, and
- there is no other upper bound ${} M' {}$ for $A {}$ such that ${} M' < M {}$
#### Example
${} A=(a,\,b) {}$. Then ${} b+1 {}$ is an upper bound for $A {}$, but not it's supremum. The supremum is $b {}$.

Similarly, ${} m \in\mathbb{R} {}$ is a greatest lower bound, or infimum of $A {}$ if
- $m {}$ is a lower bound of ${} A {}$, and
- there is no other lower bound ${} m' {}$ for $A {}$ such that ${} m<m' {}$
#### Example
$$
A=\left\{\frac{1}{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\right\},\, \qquad \mathbb{N}=\{ 1,\, 2,\, 3,\, \dots \}
$$
the infimum is 0
### Completeness
The completeness axiom for $\mathbb{R} {}$ asserts that
1. Every subset of ${} \mathbb{R} {}$ which is bounded above has a supremum. 
2. Every subset of $\mathbb{R} {}$ which is bounded below has a infimum
### Countable Sets
A subset ${} A \subseteq \mathbb{R} {}$ is called countable if it finite, or if it is equinumerous with ${} \mathbb{N} {}$.
#### Example
- $\mathbb{Z} {}$ is countable
- $\mathbb{R} {}$ is uncountable
- $\mathbb{Q} {}$ is countable
## Sequences
A sequence of real numbers ${} \{ a_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} {}$ is said to converge to a limit ${} a \in\mathbb{R} {}$ iff:
$$
\forall  \varepsilon >0:\exists  N \in \mathbb{N}:\forall  n\geq N :|a_{n}-a| <\varepsilon
$$
### Theorem 1.1
If ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} a_{n}=a {}$ and ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty}b_{n} =b {}$, then
1. 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} (a_{n} \pm b_{n}) = a\pm b
$$
2. 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} a_{n} b_{n} = ab
$$
3. 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}=\frac{a}{b}
$$
provided that ${} b\neq 0 {}$ and none of the ${} b_{n} {}$ are zero.
### Cauchy Sequences
A sequence ${} \{ a_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} {}$ is called a Cauchy sequence if
$$
\forall  \varepsilon >0: \exists  N \in \mathbb{N} :\forall n,\, m \geq N:\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \varepsilon
$$
### Theorem 1.2 (Cauchy's criterion)
A sequence of real numbers converges iff it is Cauchy
