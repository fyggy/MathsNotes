# Continuity
## Lipschitz Continuity
### Definition 1.1: Lipschitz Continuity
We say that ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is Lipschitz continuous if there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$, we have
$$
|f(x)-f(x')|\leq C |x-x'|
$$
and $C$ is called a Lipschitz constant for $f$. 

Equivalently, $f$ is Lipschitz (continuous) if
$$
\left\{  \frac{|f(x)-f(x')|}{|x-x'|} \: \middle| \: x,\, x' \in \Delta,\, x \neq x'   \right\}
$$
is bounded.
### Theorem 1.2: Lipschitz Implies Uniform
Suppose that $f$ is Lipschitz on $\Delta$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\Delta$.
#### Proof:
We claim that for all $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $\delta_{\varepsilon}>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$ with ${} |x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} {}$ we have ${} |f(x)-f(x')|<\varepsilon {}$.

We know that there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$, we have
$$
|f(x)-f(x')|\leq C |x-x'|
$$
So it suffices to take ${} \delta_{\varepsilon}=\frac{\varepsilon}{C} {}$, as then 
$$
|x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} \implies |f(x)-f(x')|<C \delta_{\varepsilon}=C\cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{C}=\varepsilon 
$$
#### Example:
Let ${} f(x)=\sqrt{x} {}$ on ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. By the Cantor Theorem, $f {}$ is uniformly continuous on ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. However, consider any ${} x_{n}\to{}0 {}$ as ${} n\to{}\infty  {}$ with ${} x_{i}\in (0,\, 1] {}$. Then
$$
\frac{|f(x_{ n})-f(0)|}{|x_{n}-0|} =\frac{\sqrt{x_{n}}}{x_{n}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x_{n}}}\to{}\infty 
$$
and so the set of the difference quotients is not bounded, and $f$ is not Lipschitz. 
#### Example:
$$
f(x)=|x|
$$
is Lipschitz on $\mathbb{R}$. 
#### Example:
Suppose that $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are Lipschitz on $\Delta$. Then
$$
f(x)=\max\{ f_{1}(x),\, f_{2}(x) \}
$$
is Lipschitz. 

Now let ${} \Delta \subseteq  \mathbb{R} {}$. Then
$$
\{ \text{continuous functions on }\Delta \} \supset  \{ \text{uniformly continuous on }\Delta  \} \supset  \{ \text{Lipschitz continuous on }\Delta \}
$$
# Differentiation Theory
## Basics
### Definition 2.1: Differentiability
Let ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$, where $\Delta$ is open. Then we say that $f$ is *differentiable at* ${} x \in \Delta {}$ if there is a real number, denote it ${} f'(x) {}$, such that
$$
\lim_{x'\tto x} \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x} =f'(x)
$$
equivalently, 
$$
\lim_{h\tto 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} =f'(x)
$$
The number ${} f\;(x)$ is the *derivative  of $f$ at $x {}$* sometimes denotes ${} \frac{d}{dx} f(x) {}$
