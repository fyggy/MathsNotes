# Continuity
## Lipschitz Continuity
### Definition 1.1: Lipschitz Continuity
We say that ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is Lipschitz continuous if there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$, we have
$$
|f(x)-f(x')|\leq C |x-x'|
$$
and $C$ is called a Lipschitz constant for $f$. 

Equivalently, $f$ is Lipschitz (continuous) if
$$
\left\{  \frac{|f(x)-f(x')|}{|x-x'|} \: \middle| \: x,\, x' \in \Delta,\, x \neq x'   \right\}
$$
is bounded.
### Theorem 1.2: Lipschitz Implies Uniform
Suppose that $f$ is Lipschitz on $\Delta$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\Delta$.
#### Proof:
We claim that for all $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $\delta_{\varepsilon}>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$ with ${} |x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} {}$ we have ${} |f(x)-f(x')|<\varepsilon {}$.

We know that there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$, we have
$$
|f(x)-f(x')|\leq C |x-x'|
$$
So it suffices to take ${} \delta_{\varepsilon}=\frac{\varepsilon}{C} {}$, as then 
$$
|x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} \implies |f(x)-f(x')|<C \delta_{\varepsilon}=C\cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{C}=\varepsilon 
$$
#### Example:
Let ${} f(x)=\sqrt{x} {}$ on ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. By the Cantor Theorem, $f {}$ is uniformly continuous on ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. However, consider any ${} x_{n}\to{}0 {}$ as ${} n\to{}\infty  {}$ with ${} x_{i}\in (0,\, 1] {}$. Then
$$
\frac{|f(x_{ n})-f(0)|}{|x_{n}-0|} =\frac{\sqrt{x_{n}}}{x_{n}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x_{n}}}\to{}\infty 
$$
and so the set of the difference quotients is not bounded, and $f$ is not Lipschitz. 
#### Example:
$$
f(x)=|x|
$$
is Lipschitz on $\mathbb{R}$. 
#### Example:
Suppose that $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are Lipschitz on $\Delta$. Then
$$
f(x)=\max\{ f_{1}(x),\, f_{2}(x) \}
$$
is Lipschitz. 

Now let ${} \Delta \subseteq  \mathbb{R} {}$. Then
$$
\{ \text{continuous functions on }\Delta \} \supset  \{ \text{uniformly continuous on }\Delta  \} \supset  \{ \text{Lipschitz continuous on }\Delta \}
$$
# Differentiation Theory
## Basics
### Definition 2.1: Differentiability
Let ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$, where $\Delta$ is open. Then we say that $f$ is *differentiable at* ${} x \in \Delta {}$ if there is a real number, denote it ${} f'(x) {}$, such that
$$
\lim_{x'\tto x} \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x} =f'(x)
$$
equivalently, 
$$
\lim_{h\tto 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} =f'(x)
$$
The number ${} f\;(x)$ is the *derivative  of $f$ at $x {}$* sometimes denotes ${} \frac{d}{dx} f(x) {}$

If the above limit does not exist $f$ is *not differentiable* at $x$.

### Theorem 2.2: Continuity of Differentiable functions
Consider ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ where $\Delta$ is open. If $f$ is differentiable at ${} x \in \Delta {}$, then it is continuous at $x$. 
#### Proof:
We claim that 
$$
\lim_{x'\tto x} f(x')-f(x)=0
$$
We know that there exists some ${} f'(x) \in \mathbb{R} {}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{x'\tto x} \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x} =f'(x)
$$
By the algebra of limits, 
$$
\begin{align}
 \lim_{x'\tto x}( f(x')-f(x)) & =\lim_{x'\tto x}  \left( (x'-x)\cdot  \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x}  \right)    \\
 & =\lim_{x'\tto x} (x-x') \cdot \lim_{x'\tto x} \left( \frac{ f(x')-f(x) }{ x'-x } \right) \\
 & =0 \cdot f'(x) \\
 & =0
 \end{align}
$$
This only works as ${} f'(x) {}$ is defined!
### Definition 2.3: Left and Right Derivatives
Let ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ with $\Delta {}$ an open interval. Then the *left* and *right derivatives* of $f$ at ${} x \in \Delta {}$ are defined to be
$$
\lim_{x'\tto x_{-}} \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x}\quad  \text{ and }\quad \lim_{x'\tto x_{+}} \frac{f(x')-f(x)}{x'-x}\quad
$$
respectively, if they exist

Now the statement ${} f$ is differentiable at ${} x \in \Delta {}$ is equivalent to the statement that the left and right derivatives exist and agree at ${} x$. 
#### Example:
Let ${} f(x)=|x| {}$ on $\mathbb{R} {}$. This function is *not* differentiable at ${} x=0 {}$, as it's left derivative at $0 {}$ is ${} -1 {}$ and it's right derivative at ${} 0 {}$ is ${} 1 {}$. Since they don't agree, then $f$ isn't differentiable at $0 {}$.
#### Definition 2.4: Differentiable on an Interval
We say that ${} f$ is differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ if $f$ differentiable for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$. We say that $f$ is continuously differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ if it is differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and ${} f'(x) {}$ is continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. We write ${} C^{1}(a,\, b) {}$ to be the set of all continuous differentiable functions on ${} (a,\, b) {}$.
#### Example:
$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
x^{2}\sin \left( \frac{1}{x} \right), & x\neq 0 \\
0, & x=0
\end{cases}
$$
![[Pasted image 20241015194128.png]]
This function has ${} f'(0)=0 {}$, but for $x\neq 0 {}$, 
$$
f'(x)=2x\sin \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)-\cos \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)
$$
so
$$
\lim_{x'\tto 0} f'(x')
$$
does not exist. This means that ${} f'(x) {}$ exists for all ${} x \in \mathbb{R} {}$, but ${} f'(x) {}$ is not continuous at $0$. 
## Mean Value Theorem
### Definition 2.5: Maximum and Minimum
Consider ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$. We say that ${} c \in \Delta {}$ is a *minimum* (*maximum*) of ${} f {}$ if ${} f(c)\leq f(x)\; \forall x \in \alpha {}$ (${} f(c)\geq f(x) \;\forall  x \in \Delta {}$). 

We say that ${} c \in \Delta {}$ is an *extremum* of $f$ if it is either a minimum of a maximum
### Definition 2.6: Local Minima and Maxima
Consider ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$. We say that ${} c \in \Delta {}$ is a *local minimum* (*local maximum*) if there exists some $\varepsilon>0 {}$ such that ${} f(c)\leq f(x) {}$ (${} f(c)\geq f(x) {}$) for all ${} x \in (c-\varepsilon,\, c+\varepsilon) {}$
### Theorem 2.7: Fermat's Theorem
Suppose that $f$ is differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. If $f$ has a local maximum or a local minimum at ${} c \in (a,\, b) {}$, then
$$
f'(c)=0
$$
#### Proof:
Suppose that $f$ has a local maximum at $c$. Then there exists some $\varepsilon>0 {}$ such that ${} f(x)-f(c)\leq 0  {}$ for all ${} x \in (c-\varepsilon,\, c+\varepsilon) {}$. Therefore
$$
\begin{align}
\forall x \in (c-\varepsilon,\, c) & : \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\geq 0\qquad \text{ and} \\
\forall x \in (c,\, c+\varepsilon) & : \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\leq  0\qquad 
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, 
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{x\tto c_{-}} \frac{ f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}  & \geq 0  \\
\lim_{x\tto c_{+}} \frac{ f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}  & \leq  0 
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, 
$$
\begin{align}
0 \geq \lim_{x\tto c_{+}} \frac{ f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}  =f'(c)=\lim_{x\tto c_{-}} \frac{ f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} 
\geq 0\end{align}
$$
so ${} f'(c)=0 {}$.
### Theorem 2.8: Rolle's Theorem
Suppose that $f$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ and differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. If ${} f(a)=f(b) {}$, then there exists some ${} c \in (a,\, b) {}$ such that ${} f'(c)=0 {}$. 
#### Proof:
Formal proof in the notes
### Theorem 2.9: Mean Value Theorem
Suppose $f$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ and differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. Then there exists some ${} c \in (a,b) {}$ such that 
$$
f'(c)=\frac{ f(b)-f(a) }{ b-a }
$$
#### Proof:
Let ${} g(x)=f(x)-f(a)-\frac{ f(b)-f(a) }{ b-a }(x-a) {}$. Note that ${} g'(x)=0 {}$ iff ${} f'(x)- \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} =0 {}$. Since
$$
g(b)=0 \text{ and }g(a)=0
$$
Therefore, by Rolle's Theorem , there exists some ${} c \in (a,\, b)  {}$ with ${} g'(c)=0 {}$.

Suppose that $f {}$ is differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. Suppose $f' {}$ is bounded. Then, by the MVT (mean value theorem), for all ${} x,\, x' \in (a,\, b) {}$, we have
$$
\frac{|f(x)-f(x')|}{|x-x'|} =|f'(y)|
$$
for some ${} y \in (x,\, x') {}$ (Suppose WLOG ${} x' >x {}$). Therefore
$$
\sup _{\substack{x,\, x' \in (a,\, b)\\x\neq x'} } \frac{|f(x)-f(x')|}{|x-x'|} \leq \sup _{y \in (a,\, b)}|f'(y)|
$$
and $f$ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant 
$$
\sup _{y \in (a,\, b)} |f'(y)|
$$
