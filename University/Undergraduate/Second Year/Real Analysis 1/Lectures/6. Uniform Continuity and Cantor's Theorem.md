# Uniform Continuity and Cantor's Theorem
## Uniform Continuity
### Definition 1.1:
A function ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is called *uniformly continuous* if
$$
\forall  \varepsilon >0:\exists  \delta_{\varepsilon} >0 :\forall x,\, x' \in \Delta: |x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x')|< \varepsilon
$$
Recall the definition of the continuity of $f$ on ${} \Delta {}$:
$$
\forall   \varepsilon >0: \forall x_{0} \in \Delta:\exists  \delta_{\varepsilon,\, x_{0}}>0:\forall  x \in \Delta:|x-x_{0}|< \delta_{\varepsilon,\, x_{0}} \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_{0})|< \varepsilon
$$

### Example:
This function is uniformly continuous, as there is a choice of ${} \delta$ that works for all ${} x \in \Delta {}$:

This function cannot be, as further along the asymptote one goes, $\delta$ tends to 0:

In fact to show that a function ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is *not* uniformly continuous, show that there exists some $\varepsilon>0 {}$ and sequences ${} x_{n},\, x'_{n} \in \Delta {}$ such that ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} |x_{n}-x'_{n}|=0 {}$, but ${} |f(x_{n})-f(x_{n}')|\geq \varepsilon {}$ 
### Example:
${} f(x)=1 /x {}$ is not uniformly continuous on ${} (0,\, \infty ) {}$. Consider ${} \varepsilon =\frac{1}{2} {}$. let ${} x_{n}=\frac{1}{2n} {}$ and ${} x_{n}'=\frac{1}{n} {}$. The ${} |x_{n}-x_{n}'|=\frac{1}{2n}\to{}0 {}$ as ${} n\to{}\infty  {}$, but ${} |f(x_{n})-f(x'_{n})|=2n-n=n>\frac{1}{2} {}$, for all ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$. 
### Example:
${} f(x)=x^{2} {}$ is not uniformly continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Let ${} x_{n}=n+\frac{1}{n} {}$, and ${} x_{n}'=n {}$. Then ${} |x_{n}-x_{n}'|=\frac{1}{n} \to{}0 {}$ as ${} n \to{}\infty  {}$, but ${} |f(x_{n})-f(x_{n}')|=\left( n+\frac{1}{n} \right)^{2}-n^{2}=2+\frac{1}{n^{2}}>2 {}$ for all ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$.
#### Example:
${} f(x)=\sin \frac{1}{x} {}$ is not uniformly continuous on ${} (0,\, 1) {}$. Take ${} x_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi n} {}$ and ${} x'_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi n+\frac{\pi}{2}} {}$. Then ${} |x_{n}-x_{n}'|\to{}0 {}$ as ${} n\to{}\infty  {}$, but ${} f(x_{n})=0 {}$ and ${} f(x_{n}')=1 {}$, so ${} |f(x_{n})-f(x_{n}')|=1 {}$

In general, if $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\Delta$, then $f$ is continuous on $\Delta$ but the reverse is not true *in general*. However, it does work for certain special domains. 

In particular, if $\Delta$ is closed and bounded. We prove this:
## Cantor's Theorem
### Theorem 1.2: Cantor's Theorem
Suppose $f$ is continuous on a closed bounded interval $\Delta$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $\Delta$
#### Proof:
We proceed by way of contradiction. Assume that there exists some ${} \varepsilon >0 {}$ such that for all ${} \delta >0 {}$, there exist ${} x,\, x' \in \Delta {}$ such that ${} |x-x'|<\delta {}$, but ${} |f(x)-f(x')|\geq \varepsilon {}$.

Let ${} \delta_{n} = \frac{1}{n} {}$ for ${} n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. By assumption, for all ${} n \in N {}$, there exist ${} x_{n},\, x_{n}' \in \Delta {}$ such that ${} |x_{n}-x_{n}'|< \delta_{n} {}$, but ${} |f(x_{n})-f(x_{n}')|\geq \varepsilon {}$. 

Since $\Delta$ is closed and bounded, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem implies that there exists some subsequence ${} \{ x_{n_{k}} \}_{k=1}^{\infty}  {}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}}=x_{*}
$$
for some ${} x_{*} \in \Delta {}$. Since ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} |x_{n}-x_{n}'|=0 {}$, we also have that 
$$
\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}}'=x_{*}
$$
(use triangle inequality). Since $f$ is continuous, then 
$$
\lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}})=f(x_{*})=\lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}}')
$$
Therefore, 
$$
0=\lim_{k\tto \infty} |f(x_{n_{k}})-f(x_{n_{k}}')|\geq \varepsilon
$$
but since ${} \varepsilon >0 {}$, this is a contradiction, and so ${} f {}$ is uniformly continuous.
