# Shape of a Function
## Monotonicity and Extrema 
#### Recall:
A function ${} f$ on an interval $\Delta$ is strictly increasing on $\Delta$ if for any ${} x_{1} <x_{2} {}$ on $\Delta$, we have ${} f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}) {}$. 

### Theorem 1.1: First Derivative Test
Let ${} f$ be continuous and differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. 
1) If ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x)\geq 0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f$ is strictly increasing (respectively non-decreasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
2) If ${} f'(x)<0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x\leq  0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f {}$ is strictly decreasing (respectively non-increasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
#### Useful for:
- Decide on which intervals ${} f$ is increasing/decreasing
- Determining the local maxima/minima of $f {}$
- Determining the points of inflection
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ for all $x$. We need to show that $f$ is strictly increasing. Let ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in (a,\, b) {}$. Apply MVT to ${} [x_{1},\, x_{2}] {}$. Then there exists some ${} c \in (x_{1},\, x_{2}) {}$ such that 
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}} >0
$$
Since ${} x_{2}-x_{1}>0 {}$, then ${} f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})>0 {}$, and $f {}$ is strictly increasing. The other cases follow similarly.
### Corollary 1.2: Zero Derivative Test
If ${} f {}$ is differentiable on an interval ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ for all ${} c \in (a,\, b) {}$, then $f {}$ is non-decreasing and non-increasing, therefore it is constant.
### Theorem 1.3: Second Derivative Test
Let ${} f \in C^{2}(a,\, b) {}$
1) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
2) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)<0 {}$, then $f {}$ has a local maximum at ${} c$.
#### Useful for:
- Determining the local maxima and minima
#### Note:
If ${} f''(c)=0 {}$, then the test is inconclusive. We may have a maxima, a minima, or an inflection. 
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$. Recall that the right derivative at ${} c {}$ is
$$
\lim_{x\tto c^{+}} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}
$$
and we have
$$
\left| \frac{f'(x)-f'(c)}{x-c} -f''(c) \right| < \varepsilon
$$
for all ${} x \in (c,\, c+\delta) {}$ for some ${} \delta >0 {}$. Choose ${} \varepsilon=\frac{f''(c)}{2}>0 {}$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{ f'(x)-f'(c) }{ x-c } -f''(c) \right|  & <\frac{f''(c)}{2} \\
0 <\frac{1}{2} f''(c)<\frac{f'(x)-f'(c)}{x-c}   & <\frac{3}{2} f''(c)
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, ${} f'(x)>0 {}$. By the first derivative test, we see that $f$ is increasing on ${} (c,\, c+\delta) {}$. Likewise, on the left derivative, we obtain that $f$ is increasing on ${} (c-\delta,\, c) {}$. Therefore, $c$ is a minima.
## Convexity and Concavity
### Definition 1.4: Convexity
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\Delta$, then $f$ is convex on $\Delta$ if, for any ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in \Delta {}$, and for any ${} \theta \in [0,\, 1] {}$, we have
$$
f(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})\leq \theta f(x_{1})+(1-\theta)f(x_{2})
$$

### Definition 1.5: Concavity
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\Delta$, then $f$ is concave on $\Delta$ if, for any ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in \Delta {}$ and for any ${} \theta \in [0,\, 1] {}$, we have
$$
f(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})\geq  \theta f(x_{1})+(1-\theta)f(x_{2})
$$
### Definition 1.6: Inflection
Let ${} x_{0} \in \mathbb{R} {}$ and $\delta>0 {}$, if $f$ is convex on ${} (x_{0},\, x_{0}+\delta) {}$ and concave on ${} (x_{0}-\delta,\, x_{0}) {}$, then $x_{0}$ is a point of inflection
### Theorem 1.7:
Let $f$ be twice differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$, and suppose that ${} f''>0 {}$ on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. Then $f$ is convex on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. 
#### Proof:
Step 1: 
Let ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in (a,\, b) {}$ with ${} x_{1} \neq x_{2} {}$. Define a function ${} g:[0,\, 1]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ by ${} g(\theta)=f(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})-\theta f(x_{1})-(1-\theta)f(x_{2}) {}$
We know that $g$ is continuous, and ${} g(0)=f(x_{2})-f(x_{2})=0 {}$, and ${} f(1)=f(x_{1})-f(x_{1})=0 {}$

We want to show that ${} g \leq 0 {}$ on ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. 

Step 2: 
Differentiate $g$ twice. Now
$$
\begin{align}
g'(\theta) & =(x_{1}-x_{2})f'(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})-f(x_{1})+f(x_{2}) \\
 g''(\theta)&=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}f''(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})>0 
\end{align}
$$
Step 3: 
Assume that $g$ is positive at some points in ${} [0,\, 1] {}$. 

Step 4:
There exists some ${} \theta_{0} \in (0,\, 1) {}$ such that $g$ attains it's maximum at $\theta_{0} {}$.

Step 5:
We know that ${} g'(\theta_{0})=0 {}$. By assumption of ${} f''>0 {}$, we get that ${} g''(\theta_{0})>0 {}$.

Step 6:
By the second derivative test, we get that $\theta_{0}$ is a local minimum. Therefore, $g$ is constant around $\theta_{0}$, and ${} g'=0 {}$ and ${} g''=0 {}$. This is a contradiction, as we showed that ${} g''>0 {}$. Therefore, $g$ is not positive at any points, and $f$ is convex. 
## Global Max and Min
### How to find
Let $f$ be a differentiable function on ${} [a,\, b] {}$. 
1. find all points ${} c_{1},\, c_{2},\,\dots,\,c_{n} \in (a,\, b) {}$ at which ${} f'(c_{k})=0 {}$
2. evaluate ${} f(c_{k}) {}$ for all $k$
3. evaluate $f$ at the endpoints ${} a,\, b {}$ of the interval
4. from the list ${} f(a),\, f(b),\, f(c_{1}),\, f(c_{2}),\,\dots,\,f(c_{n}) {}$, select the maximum
## Behaviour at Infinity
Let $f$ be a function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that ${} \lim_{x\tto \infty} f(x)=C_{0} {}$. What is the *rate* of convergence of ${} f(x)\to{}C_{0} {}$ as ${} x \to{}\infty  {}$. 

Use the asymptotic expansion to express this more precisely, i.e. express $f {}$ as
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{c_{ n}}{x^{n}}+O(x^{-N})
$$
### Definition 1.8: Linear Asymptotes
If ${} f(x)=ax+b+o(1) {}$, as ${} x\to{}\infty  {}$, we say that ${} y=ax+b {}$ is an asymptote of the graph of ${} f$. 
#### Example:
${} f(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}+x} {}$ as ${} x\to{}\infty  {}$. We find the asymptotic expansion. Note that
$$
\begin{align}
f(x) & =\sqrt{x^{2}+x} \\
 & =\sqrt{x^{2}\left( 1+\frac{1}{x} \right)}  &  & y=\frac{1}{x}\\
(1+y)^{1/2} & =1+\frac{1}{2}y-\frac{1}{8}y^{2}+O(y^{3})
\end{align}
$$
as ${} x\to{}\infty  {}$, ${} y\to{}0 {}$. Now
$$
\begin{align}
f(x) & =x\left( 1+\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x^{2}}+O\left( \frac{1}{x^{3}} \right) \right) \\
 & =x+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{8} \frac{1}{x}+O\left( \frac{1}{x^{3}} \right) \\
 & =x+\frac{1}{2}+o(1)
\end{align}
$$
