## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1
### Theorem 1.1: FTC Part 1
Let ${} f \in \mathcal{R}[a,\, b] {}$. For ${} x \in [a,\, b] {}$, put
$$
F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f(t) \ud t 
$$
Then $F$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$. Now if $f$ is continuous at ${} x_{0} \in (a,\, b) {}$, then ${} F$ is differentiable at $x_{0} {}$, and
$$
F'(x_{0})=f(x_{0})
$$
$F$ is called the primitive or antiderivative of $f$. 
#### Proof:
First we show that $F$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$. Since ${} f \in \mathcal{R}[a,\, b] {}$, then $f$ is bounded. Therefore, it has an upper bound $M$ such that 
$$
|f(t)|\leq M,\, t \in [a,\, b]
$$
Let ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in [a,\, b] {}$. WLOG suppose that ${} x_{1} \leq x_{2} {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
 |F(x_{1})-F(x_{2})| &  = \left|  \int_{a}^{x_{1}} f(t) \ud x -\int_{a}^{x_{2}} f(t) \ud x  \right|    \\
 & =\left|  \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f(x) \ud x  \right|  \\
 & \leq  (x_{2}-x_{1}) \sup _{t \in [x_{1},\, x_{2}]} |f(t)| \\
 & \leq  (x_{2}-x_{1})M
 \end{align}

$$
and therefore $F$ is Lipschitz continuous, and therefore continuous. 

Now suppose that $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$. Then given some $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $\delta>0 {}$ such that ${} |f(s)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon {}$ if ${} |s-x_{0}|<\delta {}$. 

Now consider the right derivative of $F$. Let ${} t \in (x_{0},\, x_{0}+\delta) {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{ F(t)-F(x_{0}) }{ t-x_{0} } -f(x_{0})\right| &  =\left| \frac{1}{t-x_{0}}\int_{a}^{t} f(s) \ud s -\frac{1}{t-x_{0}} \int_{a}^{x_{0}} f(s) \ud s -f(x_{0})\right|  \\
 & =\left| \frac{1}{t-x_{0}} \int_{x_{0}}^{t} f(s) \ud s -f(x_{0}) \right|  \\
& =\left| \frac{1}{t-x_{0}} \int_{x_{0}}^{t} f(s) \ud s -\frac{1}{t-x_{0}}\int_{x_{0}}^{t} f(x_{0}) \ud s  \right|  \\
 & =\left| \frac{1}{t-x_{0}} \int_{x_{0}}^{t}( f(s)-f(x_{0})) \ud s  \right|  \\
 & \leq \left|\frac{1}{t-x_{0}}(t-x_{0}) \sup _{s \in [x_{0},\, t] }|f(s)-f(x_{0})|\right| \\
 & <\varepsilon
\end{align}
$$
and so
$$
\lim_{t\tto x_{0}^{+}} \frac{ F(t)-F(x_{0}) }{ t-x_{0} } =f(x_{0})
$$
and likewise for the left derivativ
