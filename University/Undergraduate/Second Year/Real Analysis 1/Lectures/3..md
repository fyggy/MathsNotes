# Preliminaries
## Big and Little O notation
### Definition 1.1: Big O notation
Let ${} f,\, g :\Delta\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$, where $\Delta {}$ is an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$. Consider ${} x_{0} \in \Delta {}$. Suppose there exists some $a>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a,\, x_{0}+a) -\{ x_{0} \} {}$, then ${} g(x)\neq 0$. We then write 
$$
f(x)=O(g(x)) \text{ as } x\to{}x_{0}
$$
if there exists some ${} a' \in (0,\, a) {}$ such that ${} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} {}$ is *bounded* for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a',\, x_{0}+a')-\{ x_{0} \} {}$. 

Equivalently, there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that
$$
|f(x)|\leq C|g(x)|
$$
for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a',\, x_{0}+a')-\{ x_{0} \} {}$.

Now suppose that ${} f,\, g :\left( a,\, \infty  \right)\to{} \mathbb{R} {}$. Suppose that there exists some $R\geq a$ such that ${} g(x)\neq 0$ for all $x >R {}$. We write ${} f(x)=O(g(x)) {}$ as ${} x \to{}\infty  {}$ iff there exists some $R'\geq R {}$ such that ${} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} {}$ is bounded for all $x>R' {}$.

Equivalently, that there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x>R' {}$, then
$$
|f(x)|\leq C|g(x)|
$$
### Definition 1.2: Little o notation
We write that ${} f(x)=o(g(x)) {}$ as ${} x\to{}x_{0} {}$ if
$$
\lim_{x\tto x_{0}} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =0
$$
equivalently, for all ${} \varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $\delta>0 {}$ such that ${} |f(x)|\leq \varepsilon |g(x)| {}$ for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-\delta,\, x_{0}-{\delta})-\{ x_{0} \} {}$.

We write ${} f(x)=o(g(x)) {}$ if
$$
\lim_{x\tto \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=0
$$
#### Example
For al, ${} n,\, m \in \mathbb{N} {}$ such that $n>m {}$, we have that ${} x^{n}=o(x^{m}) {}$ as ${} x\to{}0 {}$
#### Example:
For all ${} \alpha \in \mathbb{R} {}$, we have 
$$
(1+x)^{\alpha}-(1+\alpha x)=O(|x|^{2})
$$
as ${} x\to{}0 {}$.
This is known as the binomial approximation.
#### Example:
We have that
$$
\log x=o(x^{\alpha})
$$
as ${} x\to{}\infty  {}$ for all $\alpha>0 {}$. 
#### Example:
For ${} x \in \left[ 0,\, \infty  \right) {}$, we define
$$
\pi(x)=\text{\# of prime numbers } \leq x
$$
Then the Prime Number Theorem tells us that
$$
\lim_{x\tto \infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log t} \ud t }=1
$$
How large is 
$$
E(x)=|\pi(x)-\int_{2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\log t} \ud t |
$$
when $x$ is large? We have the conjecture
$$
E(x)=O(\sqrt{x}\log x)
$$
as ${} x\to{}\infty  {}$. This is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.
# Continuity
## Continuity at a Point
### Definition 2.1: Continuity at a Point
Let ${} f:(a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$, and let ${} x_{0} \in (a,\, b) {}$. We say that $f {}$ is *continuous at ${} x_{0} {}$* if
$$
\lim_{x\tto x_{0}} f(x)=f(x_{0})
$$
Equivalently, 
$$
\forall \varepsilon >0:\exists ~\delta>0:0<|x-x_{0}|<\delta\Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon
$$
We then write ${} f \in C(a,\, b) {}$ iff $f$ is continuous at every ${} x_{0} \in (a,\, b) {}$. 
#### Example:
Consider ${} f(x)=\sqrt{x} {}$ on ${} \left( 0,\, \infty  \right) {}$. We claim that $f$ is continuous on ${} \left( 0,\, \infty  \right) {}$. 
##### Proof:
Consider ${} x_{0} \in \left( 0,\, \infty \right) {}$. Let $\varepsilon>0 {}$. We claim that there exists some $\delta>0 {}$ such that if ${} 0<|x-x_{0}|<\delta {}$, then ${} |f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\varepsilon {}$. Observe that for $x>0 {}$, then 
$$
\begin{align}
 x-x_{0}=(\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{x_{0}})(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{x_{0}})

 \end{align}
$$
and so
$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{x_{0}}=\frac{x-x_{0}}{} 
\end{align}
$$
