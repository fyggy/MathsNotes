# Preliminaries
## Big and Little O notation
### Definition 1.1: Big O notation
Let ${} f,\, g :\Delta\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$, where $\Delta {}$ is an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$. Consider ${} x_{0} \in \Delta {}$. Suppose there exists some $a>0 {}$ such that for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a,\, x_{0}+a) -\{ x_{0} \} {}$, then ${} g(x)\neq 0$. We then write 
$$
f(x)=O(g(x)) \text{ as } x\to{}x_{0}
$$
if there exists some ${} a' \in (0,\, a) {}$ such that ${} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} {}$ is *bounded* for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a,\, x_{0}+a)-\{ x_{0} \} {}$. 

Equivalently, there exists some $C>0 {}$ such that
$$
|f(x)|\leq C|g(x)|
$$
for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-a',\, x_{0}+a')-\{ x_{0} \} {}$.
### Definition 1.2: Little o notation
We write that ${} f(x)=o(g(x)) {}$ as ${} x\to{}x_{0} {}$ if
$$
\lim_{x\tto x_{0}} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =0
$$
equivalently, for all ${} \varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $\delta>0 {}$ such that ${} |f(x)|\leq \varepsilon |g(x)| {}$ for all ${} x \in (x_{0}-\delta,\, x_{0}-{\delta})-\{ x_{0} \} {}$.
#### Example
For al, ${} n,\, m \in \mathbb{N} {}$ such that $n>m {}$, we have that ${} x^{n}=o(x^{m}) {}$ as ${} x\to{}0 {}$
#### Example:
For all ${} \alpha \in \mathbb{R} {}$, we have 
$$
(1+x)^{\alpha}-(1+\alpha x)=O(|x|^{2})
$$
as ${} x\to{}0 {}$.
This is known as the binomial approximation
