# Uniform Continuity and Cantor's Theorem
## 
### Definition 1.1:
A function ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is called *uniformly continuous* if
$$
\forall  \varepsilon >0:\exists  \delta_{\varepsilon} >0 :\forall x,\, x' \in \Delta: |x-x'|<\delta_{\varepsilon} \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x')|< \varepsilon
$$
Recall the definition of the continuity of $f$ on ${} \Delta {}$:
$$
\forall   \varepsilon >0: \forall x_{0} \in \Delta:\exists  \delta_{\varepsilon,\, x_{0}}>0:\forall  x \in \Delta:|x-x_{0}|< \delta_{\varepsilon,\, x_{0}} \Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_{0})|< \varepsilon
$$

### Example:
This function is uniformly continuous, as there is a choice of ${} \delta$ that works for all ${} x \in \Delta {}$:

This function cannot be, as further along the asymtote one goes, $\delta$ tends to 0:

In fact to show that a function ${} f:\Delta \to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is *not* uniformly continuous, show that there exists some $\varepsilon>0 {}$ and sequences ${} x_{n},\, x'_{n} \in \Delta {}$
