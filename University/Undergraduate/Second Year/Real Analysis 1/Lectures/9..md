## Monotonicity and Extrema 
#### Recall:
A function $f$ on an interval $\Delta$ is strictly increasing on $\Delta$ if for any ${} x_{1} <x_{2} {}$ on $\Delta$, we have ${} f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}) {}$. 

### Theorem 1.1: First Derivative Test
Let ${} f$ be continuous and differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. 
1) If ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x)\geq 0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f$ is strictly increasing (respectively non-decreasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
2) If ${} f'(x)<0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x\leq  0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f {}$ is strictly decreasing (respectively non-increasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
#### Useful for:
- Decide on which intervals ${} f$ is increasing/decreasing
- Determining the local maxima/minima of $f {}$
- Determining the points of inflection
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ for all $x$. We need to show that $f$ is strictly increasing. Let ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in (a,\, b) {}$. Apply MVT to ${} [x_{1},\, x_{2}] {}$. Then there exists some ${} c \in (x_{1},\, x_{2}) {}$ such that 
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}} >0
$$
Since ${} x_{2}-x_{1}>0 {}$, then ${} f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})>0 {}$, and $f {}$ is strictly increasing. The other cases follow similarly.
### Corollary 1.2: Zero Derivative Test
If ${} f {}$ is differentiable on an interval ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ for all ${} c \in (a,\, b) {}$, then $f {}$ is non-decreasing and non-increasing, therefore it is constant.
### Theorem 1.3: Second Derivative Test
Let ${} f \in C^{2}(a,\, b) {}$
1) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
2) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)<0 {}$, then $f {}$ has a local maximum at ${} c$.
#### Useful for:
- Determining the local maxima and minima
#### Note:
If ${} f''(c)=0 {}$, then the test is inconclusive. We may have a maxima, a minima, or an inflection. 
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$. Recall that the right derivative at ${} c {}$ is
$$
\lim_{x\tto c^{+}} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}
$$
and we have
$$
\left| \frac{f'(x)-f'(c)}{x-c} -f''(c) \right| < \varepsilon
$$
for all ${} x \in (c,\, c+\delta) {}$ for some ${} \delta >0 {}$. Choose ${} \varepsilon=\frac{f''(c)}{2}>0 {}$. Then
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \frac{ f'(x)-f'(c) }{ x-c } -f''(c) \right|  & <\frac{f''(c)}{2} \\
0 <\frac{1}{2} f''(c)<\frac{f'(x)-f'(c)}{x-c}   & <\frac{3}{2} f''(c)
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, ${} f'(x)>0 {}$. By the first derivative test, we see that $f$ is increasing on ${} (c,\, c+\delta) {}$. Likewise, on the left derivative, we obtain that $f$ is increasing on ${} (c-\delta,\, c) {}$. Therefore, $c$ is a minima.
## Convexity and Concavity
### Definition 1.4: Convexity
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\Delta$, then $f$ is convex on $\Delta$ if, for any ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in \Delta {}$, and for any ${} \theta \in [0,\, 1] {}$, we have
$$
f(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})\leq \theta f(x_{1})+(1-\theta)f(x_{2})
$$

### Definition 1.5: Concavity
Let $f$ be a continuous function on $\Delta$, then $f$ is concave on $\Delta$ if, for any ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in \Delta {}$ and for any ${} \theta \in [0,\, 1] {}$, we have
$$
f(\theta x_{1}+(1-\theta)x_{2})\geq  \theta f(x_{1})+(1-\theta)f(x_{2})
$$
### Definition 1.6: Inflection
Let ${} x_{0} \in \mathbb{R} {}$ and $\delta>0 {}$, if $f$ is convex on ${} (x_{0},\, x_{0}+\delta) {}$ and concave on ${} (x_{0}-\delta,\, x_{0}) {}$, then $x_{0}$ is a point of inflection
### Theorem 1.7:
Let $f$ be twice differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$, and suppose that ${} f''>0 {}$ on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. Then $f$ is convex on ${} (a,\, b) {}$.
