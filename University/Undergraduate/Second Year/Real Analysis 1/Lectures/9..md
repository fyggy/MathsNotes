## Monotonicity and Extrema 
#### Recall:
A function $f$ on an interval $\Delta$ is strictly increasing on $\Delta$ if for any ${} x_{1} <x_{2} {}$ on $\Delta$, we have ${} f(x_{1})<f(x_{2}) {}$. 

### Theorem 1.1: First Derivative Test
Let ${} f$ be continuous and differentiable on ${} (a,\, b) {}$. 
1) If ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x)\geq 0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f$ is strictly increasing (respectively non-decreasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
2) If ${} f'(x)<0 {}$ (respectively ${} f'(x\leq  0 {}$) for all ${} x \in (a,\, b) {}$, then the function $f {}$ is strictly decreasing (respectively non-increasing) on ${} (a,\, b) {}$
#### Useful for:
- Decide on which intervals ${} f$ is increasing/decreasing
- Determining the local maxima/minima of $f {}$
- Determining the points of inflection
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(x)>0 {}$ for all $x$. We need to show that $f$ is strictly increasing. Let ${} x_{1},\, x_{2} \in (a,\, b) {}$. Apply MVT to ${} [x_{1},\, x_{2}] {}$. Then there exists some ${} c \in (x_{1},\, x_{2}) {}$ such that 
$$
f'(c)=\frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}} >0
$$
Since ${} x_{2}-x_{1}>0 {}$, then ${} f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})>0 {}$, and $f {}$ is strictly increasing. The other cases follow similarly.
### Corollary 1.2: Zero Derivative Test
If ${} f {}$ is differentiable on an interval ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ for all ${} c \in (a,\, b) {}$, then $f {}$ is non-decreasing and non-increasing, therefore it is constant.
### Theorem 1.2: Second Derivative Test
Let ${} f \in C^{2}(a,\, b) {}$
1) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
2) If ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)<0 {}$, then $f {}$ has a local maximum at ${} c$.
#### Useful for:
- Determining the local maxima and minima
#### Note:
If ${} f''(c)=0 {}$, then the test is inconclusive. We may have a maxima, a minima, or an inflection. 
#### Proof:
Assume that ${} f'(c)=0 {}$ and ${} f''(c)>0 {}$. The right derivative at $c {}$ of
$$
\lim_{x\tto c^{+}} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}
