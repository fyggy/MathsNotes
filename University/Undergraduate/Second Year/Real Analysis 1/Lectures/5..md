# Continuity on an Interval
## Preliminaries
### Definition 1.1:
We say that ${} f:[a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b) {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$, and 
$$
\lim_{x\tto a_{+}} f(x)=f(a)
$$
Similarly ${} f:(a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} (a,\, b] {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and
$$
\lim_{x\tto b_{-}} f(x)=f(b)
$$
Finally ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b] {}$ and ${} [a,\, b) {}$.
#### Example:
$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
e^{-1/x}, & x>0 \\
0 , & x=0
\end{cases}
$$
Is continuous on ${} [0,\, \infty ) {}$.
#### Notation:
The set of all functions continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ is denoted ${} C(a,\, b) {}$
The set of all functions continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ is denoted $C{} [a,\, b] {}$

Similarly, ${} C(\mathbb{R}) {}$ is the set of continuous functions on $\mathbb{R} {}$.
## Three Important Theorems
### Theorem 1.2: Boundedness Theorem
If $f$ is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval, then $f$ is bounded on that same interval.
#### Proof:
Let $f$ be continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ with ${} a>-\infty  {}$ and ${} b<\infty  {}$. BWOC, assume that ${} f$ is unbounded. That is, for all ${} M \in \mathbb{R} {}$, there exists some ${} x \in [a,\, b] {}$ such that ${} |f(x)|\geq M {}$. Let ${} M_{n}=n {}$ and let ${} x_{n} \in  [a,\, b] {}$ be such that ${} |f(x_{n})|\geq M_{n} {}$. Since ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} M_{n}=\infty  {}$, and ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} |f(x_{n})|=\infty  {}$. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, since ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}  {}$ is bounded, then there exists a convergent subsequence, call it ${} \{ x_{n_{k}} \}_{k=1}^{\infty}  {}$. 

Now let ${} c=\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}} {}$. Since $f$ is continuous, then ${} \lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}})=f(c) {}$. This contradicts the fact that ${} \lim_{k\tto \infty} |f(x_{n_{k}})|=\infty  {}$, and so $f$ is bounded. 
### Corollary 1.3:
Let ${} a \in \mathbb{R} {}$, and let ${} f \in [a,\, \infty )\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ be continuous on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$. Suppose that 
$$
\lim_{x\tto \infty} f(x)=A
$$
For some finite ${} A \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Then ${} f {}$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$. 
#### Proof:
By definition, for all $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $a_{0}\geq a$ such that ${} x\geq a_{0}\Rightarrow |f(x)-A|<\varepsilon {}$. Take ${} \varepsilon=1 {}$. Then we get that there exists some ${} a_{0} \geq 0 {}$ such that ${} x\geq a_{0}\Rightarrow |f(x)-A|< \varepsilon {}$. 
So, for ${} x \geq a_{0} {}$, we have that
$$
|f(x)|=|f(x)-A+A|\leq |f(a)-A|+|A|< 1+A<\infty 
$$
and $f$ is bounded on the interval ${} [a_{0},\, \infty ) {}$. Then, by the boundedness theorem, we have that $f$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, a_{0}] {}$. Therefore, $f$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$
### Theorem 1.4: Maximum/Minimum Theorem
If $f$ is continuous on a closed and bounded interval, then $f$ attains it's maximum and interval. In particular, let ${} [a,\, b] {}$ denote the interval. Then, there exists some ${} \conj{c} {}$
