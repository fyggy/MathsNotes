# Continuity on an Interval
## Preliminaries
### Definition 1.1:
We say that ${} f:[a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b) {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$, and 
$$
\lim_{x\tto a_{+}} f(x)=f(a)
$$
Similarly ${} f:(a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} (a,\, b] {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ and
$$
\lim_{x\tto b_{-}} f(x)=f(b)
$$
Finally ${} f:[a,\, b]\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ if it is continuous on ${} (a,\, b] {}$ and ${} [a,\, b) {}$.
#### Example:
$$
f(x)=\begin{cases}
e^{-1/x}, & x>0 \\
0 , & x=0
\end{cases}
$$
Is continuous on ${} [0,\, \infty ) {}$.
#### Notation:
The set of all functions continuous on ${} (a,\, b) {}$ is denoted ${} C(a,\, b) {}$
The set of all functions continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ is denoted $C{} [a,\, b] {}$

Similarly, ${} C(\mathbb{R}) {}$ is the set of continuous functions on $\mathbb{R} {}$.
## Three Important Theorems
### Theorem 1.2: Boundedness Theorem
If $f$ is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval, then $f$ is bounded on that same interval.
#### Proof:
Let $f$ be continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$ with ${} a>-\infty  {}$ and ${} b<\infty  {}$. BWOC, assume that ${} f$ is unbounded. That is, for all ${} M \in \mathbb{R} {}$, there exists some ${} x \in [a,\, b] {}$ such that ${} |f(x)|\geq M {}$. Let ${} M_{n}=n {}$ and let ${} x_{n} \in  [a,\, b] {}$ be such that ${} |f(x_{n})|\geq M_{n} {}$. Since ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} M_{n}=\infty  {}$, and ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} |f(x_{n})|=\infty  {}$. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, since ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}  {}$ is bounded, then there exists a convergent subsequence, call it ${} \{ x_{n_{k}} \}_{k=1}^{\infty}  {}$. 

Now let ${} c=\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}} {}$. Since $f$ is continuous, then ${} \lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}})=f(c) {}$. This contradicts the fact that ${} \lim_{k\tto \infty} |f(x_{n_{k}})|=\infty  {}$, and so $f$ is bounded. 
### Corollary 1.3:
Let ${} a \in \mathbb{R} {}$, and let ${} f \in [a,\, \infty )\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ be continuous on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$. Suppose that 
$$
\lim_{x\tto \infty} f(x)=A
$$
For some finite ${} A \in \mathbb{R} {}$. Then ${} f {}$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$. 
#### Proof:
By definition, for all $\varepsilon>0 {}$, there exists some $a_{0}\geq a$ such that ${} x\geq a_{0}\Rightarrow |f(x)-A|<\varepsilon {}$. Take ${} \varepsilon=1 {}$. Then we get that there exists some ${} a_{0} \geq 0 {}$ such that ${} x\geq a_{0}\Rightarrow |f(x)-A|< \varepsilon {}$. 
So, for ${} x \geq a_{0} {}$, we have that
$$
|f(x)|=|f(x)-A+A|\leq |f(a)-A|+|A|< 1+A<\infty 
$$
and $f$ is bounded on the interval ${} [a_{0},\, \infty ) {}$. Then, by the boundedness theorem, we have that $f$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, a_{0}] {}$. Therefore, $f$ is bounded on ${} [a,\, \infty ) {}$
### Theorem 1.4: Maximum/Minimum Theorem
If $f$ is continuous on a closed and bounded interval, then $f$ attains it's maximum and interval. In particular, let ${} [a,\, b] {}$ denote the interval. Then, there exists some ${} \conj{c} \in [a,\, b] {}$ such that
$$
f(\conj{c})=\sup \{ f(x) \mid  x \in [a,\, b] \}=\sup f
$$
Simiarily, there exists some ${} \underline{c} \in [a,\, b] {}$ such that
$$
f(\underline{c})=\inf \{ f(x) \mid  x \in [a,\, b] \}=\inf f
$$
#### Proof:
Let ${} M=\sup f {}$. Then, there exists a sequence ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq [a,\, b]  {}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=M
$$
Since ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}  {}$ is bounded, there exists a subsequence ${} \{ x_{n_{k}} \}_{k=1}^{\infty}  {}$ which converges. Let ${} \conj{c}=\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}} {}$. Since $f$ is continuous, then 
$$
M=\lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}})=f(\conj{c})
$$
and so $f {}$ attains it's maximum. 

Now let ${} m=\inf  f {}$. Then, there exists a sequence ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq [a,\, b]  {}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=m
$$
Since ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}  {}$ is bounded, there exists a subsequence ${} \{ x_{n_{k}} \}_{k=1}^{\infty}  {}$ which converges. Let ${} \underline{c}=\lim_{k\tto \infty} x_{n_{k}} {}$. Since $f$ is continuous, then 
$$
m=\lim_{k\tto \infty} f(x_{n_{k}})=f(\underline{c})
$$
and so ${} f$ attains it's minimum.
### Theorem 1.5: Intermediate Value Theorem
Let $f$ be continuous on ${} [a,\, b] {}$. Then $f$ attains every value between ${} f(a)$ and ${} f(b)$.
#### Proof:
Let $d$ be a point between ${} f(a)$ and ${} f(b) {}$. We claim that there exists some ${} c \in [a,\, b] {}$ such that ${} f(c)=d {}$. 

If ${} f(a)=f(b) {}$. Then, ${} d=f(a)=f(b) {}$, so ${} c=a {}$. 

Otherwise, ${} f(a)\neq f(b) {}$. Suppose that ${} f(a)<f(b) {}$. Consider the midpoint ${} m_{1}=\frac{ a+b }{ 2 } {}$. If ${} f(m)=d {}$, we are done. If ${} f(m_{1})<d {}$, let ${} a_{1}=m_{1} {}$, and let ${} b_{1}=b {}$. Otherwise, let ${} a_{1}=a {}$, and ${} b_{1}=m_{1} {}$. Then ${} [a_{1},\, b_{1}] {}$ is half the size of ${} [a,\, b] {}$, but we still have that ${} f(a_{1})<d {}$ and ${} f(b_{1})>d {}$.

We continue in this way, defining a sequence of intervals
$$
([a,\, b],\, [a_{1},\, b_{1}],\, [a_{2},\, b_{2}],\,\dots)
$$
with
$$
[a,\, b] \supseteq [a_{1},\, b_{1}] \supseteq \dots 
$$
such that, unless the procedure terminates, for all ${} j \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, we have ${} f(a_{j})<d {}$ and ${} f(b_{j})>d {}$. This is achieved inductively. Suppose that ${} [a_{j-1},\, b_{j-1}] {}$ is defined such that ${} f(a_{j-1})<d {}$ and ${} f(b_{j-1})>d {}$. Then, if
$$
f\left( \frac{ a_{j-1}+b_{j-1} }{ 2 } \right)=d
$$
we are done, if
$$
f\left( \frac{ a_{j-1}+b_{j-1} }{ 2 }\right)<d
$$, then let ${} a_{j}= \frac{ a_{j-1}+b_{j-1} }{ 2 } {}$ and ${} b_{j}=b_{j-1} {}$, and if
$$
f \left(  \frac{ a_{j-1}+b_{j-1} }{ 2 } \right) >d
$$
then let ${} a_{j}=a_{j-1} {}$ and ${} b_{j}= \frac{ a_{j-1}+b_{j-1} }{ 2 } {}$. Since $a_{j} {}$ and ${} b_{j}$ converge
