# Convergence
## Continuity and Convergent Sequences  
### Theorem 1.1:
Let ${} f:(a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R}$, and let ${} x_{0} \in (a,\, b) {}$. Then if ${} y_{0} \in \mathbb{R} {}$, the following are equivalent: 
1. ${} \lim_{x\tto x_{0}} f(x)=y_{0} {}$
2. For all sequences ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq  (a,\, b) \setminus \{ x_{0} \} {}$ such that ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} x_{n}=x_{0} {}$, we have that
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=y_{0}
$$

#### Proof:
First, (1 $\Rightarrow$ 2). Suppose that ${} \lim_{x\tto x_{0}} f(x)=y_{0} {}$. Let ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq (a,\, b) \setminus  \{ x_{0} \} {}$ be such that 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} x_{n}=x_{0}
$$
We claim that ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=y_{0} {}$. We know that 
$$
\forall \varepsilon >0:\exists  \delta_{\varepsilon}>0: 0<|x-x_{0}| < \delta_{\varepsilon}\Rightarrow |f(x)-y_{0}|<\varepsilon \tag{*}
$$
We also know that
$$
\forall \delta >0:\exists N_{\delta} \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}:n\geq N_{\delta}\Rightarrow |x_{n}-x_{0}|< \delta \tag{**}
$$
Therefore, given ${} \varepsilon>0 {}$, then taking $\delta=\delta_{\varepsilon} {}$ in ${} (**) {}$, we get that ${} |x_{n}-x_{0}|<\delta_{\varepsilon}$ for all $n\geq N_{\delta_{\varepsilon}} {}$. Since ${} x_{i}\neq x_{0}$ for all ${} i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, then ${} 0<|x_{n}-x_{0}|< \delta_{\varepsilon} {}$, and so ${} |f(x_{n})-y_{0}|<\varepsilon$ by ${} (*) {}$. Therefore, 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=y_{0}
$$
Now we show that ${} 2\Rightarrow 1 {}$. We proceed by contrapositive. Suppose that
$$
\lim_{x\tto x_{0}} f(x)\neq y_{0}
$$
Then
$$
\exists \varepsilon>0:\forall  \delta >0: \exists  x_{\delta}' \in (x_{0}-\delta,\, x_{0}+\delta) \setminus \{ x_{0} \}:|f(x'_{\delta})-y_{0}|\geq \varepsilon
$$
Let ${} \delta_{n}=\frac{1}{n} {}$ for ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$, and set ${} x_{n}=x_{\delta_{n}}' {}$. Then since ${} |x_{n}-x_{0}|<\frac{1}{n} {}$, for all ${} n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$, we know that
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} x_{n}=x_{0}
$$
Furthermore, by the definition of ${} x_{\delta_{n}}' {}$, that ${} |f(x_{n})-y_{0}|\geq \varepsilon {}$, for all ${} \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} {}$. In particular, ${} f(x_{n})$ fails to converge to $y_{0}$ as ${} n\to{}\infty {}$. Therefore, $2$ is false, and so ${} 2\Rightarrow 1 {}$. 
#todo have a closer look at this
### Corollary 1.2:
We have that ${} f:(a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at ${} x_{0} \in (a,\, b) {}$ iff for all sequences ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq (a,\, b) {}$ such that ${} \lim_{n\tto \infty} x_{n}=x_{0} {}$, we have 
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=f(x_{0})
$$
## Algebra of Continuous Functions
### Theorem 1.3:
Suppose ${} f,\, g:(a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ are both continuous at $x_{0}$. Then $f+g {}$ and $f\cdot g$ are continuous at $x_{0}$. If ${} g(x_{0})\neq 0$, then ${} f /g {}$ is continuous at $x_{0} {}$.
#### Proof:
#todo 
#### Example:
Every polynomial on $\mathbb{R}$ is continuous
### Theorem 1.4:
Suppose ${} f:(a,\, b)\to{}\mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $x_{0}$, and let ${} g:\im f\to{}\mathbb{R} {}$ is continuous at ${} f(x_{0})$. Then ${} g \circ f {}$ is continuous at $x_{0}$.
#### Proof:
Let ${} \{ x_{n} \}_{n=1}^{\infty}  {}$ be a sequence converging to $x_{0}$. Since $f$ is continuous at $x_{0}$, then we have
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} f(x_{n})=f(x_{0})
$$
Since $g$ is continuous at ${} f(x_{0})$, then we conclude that
$$
\lim_{n\tto \infty} g(f(x_{n}))=g(f(x_{0}))
$$
and so ${} g \circ  f {}$ is continuous.
