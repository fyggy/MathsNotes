1. 
Let ${} p \in (a,\, b) {}$. Then let ${} d=\max(|p-a|,\, |p-b|) {}$. Now let ${} S=\left( p-\frac{d}{2} ,\, p+\frac{d}{2}\right) {}$. Note that ${} p-\frac{d}{2}>a {}$, and that ${} p+\frac{d}{2} <b {}$, so ${} S \subseteq (a,\, b) {}$.

a)
We have that ${} 3x-x^{3} \geq 0 {}$, so ${} 3x\geq x^{3} {}$. Now, if ${} x<0 {}$, then ${} 3\leq x^{2} {}$, or that ${} x\geq \sqrt{3} {}$ or ${} x\leq -\sqrt{3} {}$. Since ${} x<0 {}$, then we may simply write ${} x\leq  -\sqrt{3} {}$. 

Otherwise, if ${} x\geq 0 {}$, then ${} 3\geq x^{2} {}$, and so ${} x\leq \sqrt{3} {}$ or ${} x\geq -\sqrt{3} {}$. Since ${} x\geq 0 {}$, then we may simply write ${} x\leq \sqrt{3} {}$. Therefore, ${} x\leq \sqrt{3} {}$.

In total, the natural domain consists of 
$$
D=(-\infty,\, -\sqrt{3}] \cup [0,\, \sqrt{3}]
$$
b)
First, note that ${} x\neq 1 {}$. Then, we have that ${} \frac{ 1+x }{ 1-x }\geq 0 {}$. Then ${} 1+x\geq 0 {}$, or ${} x\geq -1 {}$. Now the natural domain consists of
$$
D=[-1,\, \infty ) \setminus \{ 1 \}
$$
c)
We have that ${} \cos x\geq 0 {}$. Therefore, if ${} x \in [0,\, 2\pi] {}$, then ${} 0\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2} {}$ or ${} \frac{3\pi}{4}\leq x\leq 2\pi {}$. Therefore, the natural domain is
$$
D=\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} \left[ 2\pi n,\, 2\pi n+\frac{\pi}{2} \right] \cup \left[ 2\pi n+\frac{3\pi}{4},\, 2\pi n+2\pi \right]
$$
d)
First, note that ${} x\geq 0 {}$. Now, if ${} \sin \pi x=0 {}$, then ${} f(x) {}$ is not defined. Therefore, if ${} x=n \in \mathbb{Z} {}$, then ${} f(x) {}$ is not defined. Therefore, the natural domain is
$$
D=[0,\, \infty) \setminus \mathbb{Z}
$$
