### Theorem 1.1
Let ${} f, g:\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ be continuous at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$. Then so are $\lambda f+\mu g$ for all ${} \lambda,\, \mu \in \mathbb{C} {}$, the product $fg {}$, and if ${} g(z_{0})\neq 0 {}$, then the quotient ${} f /g {}$. 

If ${} f:\Omega\to{}G \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$ is continuous at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega {}$, and ${} g:G \to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ is continuous at ${} f(z_{0})$, then ${} g \circ f {}$ is continuous at $z_{0}$. 

Let ${} u(z)=\mathrm{Re}(f(z)),\, v(z)=\mathrm{Im}(f(z)) {}$. So
$$
f(z)=u(z)+iv(z)=u(x,\, y)+iv(x,\, y)
$$
where ${} z=x+iy {}$. We know that ${} f(z_{n}) {}$ converge to ${} f(z_{0})$ iff ${} u(z_{n}) {}$ and ${} v(z_{n}) {}$ converge to ${} u(z_{0})$ and ${} v(z_{0})$ respectively. 

### Definition 1.2:
Let ${} \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$ be an open set, and let ${} z_{0} \in \Omega {}$. We say that a function $f:\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ is differentiable (or $\mathbb{C}$-differentiable) at $z_{0}$ if there exists some ${} A \in \mathbb{C} {}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}}=A 
$$
i.e. for every ${} \varepsilon >0 {}$ there exists some $\delta$ such that
$$
0< |z-z_{0}|<\delta \Rightarrow \left| \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}} -A \right| <\varepsilon
$$
the number $A$ is said to be the derivative of $f$ at the point $z_{0}$ and is denoted by ${} f'(z_{0}) {}$.

The function $f:\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ is said to be differentiable if it is differentiable at every point of the set ${} \Omega$. Then it's derivative ${} f' {}$ is a complex-valued function ${} f':\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$. 

Clearly, 
$$
f'(z_{0})=\lim_{h\tto 0} \frac{f(z_{0}+h)-f(z_{0})}{h} 
$$
it follows from the above that $f$ is differentiable at $z_{0}$ iff ${} \frac{f(z_{ n})-f(z_{0})}{z_{n}-z_{0}}\to{}f'(z_{0}) {}$ for every sequence ${} \{ z_{n} \}_{n=0}^{\infty} \subseteq \Omega {}$ which converges to $z_{0}$ such that ${} z_{n}\neq z_{0}$ for all ${} n \in \mathbb{N} {}$.
### Theorem 1.3:
If ${} f:\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ is differentiable at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega {}$, then $f$ is continuous at $z_{0}$.
#### Proof:
$$
\begin{align}
\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} f(z) & =\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} (f(z_{0})+f(z)-f(z_{0})) \\
 & =\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} f(z_{0})+\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} (f(z)-f(z_{0})) \\
 & =f(z_{0})+\lim_{z\tto z_{0}} \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}} (z-z_{0}) \\
 & =f(z_{0})+\lim_{z\tto z_{0}}  \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}} \lim_{z\tto z_{0}} (z-z_{0}) \\
 & =f(z_{0})+f'(z_{0})\cdot 0 \\
 & =f(z_{0})
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $z_{0}$.

The product rule and quotient rule, and the linearity of differentiation all still hold. 
### Theorem 1.4: Chain Rule
Let $f$ be defined on an open set ${} \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$ and differentiable at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega {}$, and let $g {}$ be defined on an open set containing the image ${} f(\Omega) {}$ and differentiable at ${} f(z_{0}) \in f(\Omega) {}$. Then the composition ${} g \circ  f {}$ is differentiable at $z_{0}$, and takes the value
$$
(g \circ  f)'(z_{0})=g'(f(z_{0}))\cdot f'(z_{0})
$$
