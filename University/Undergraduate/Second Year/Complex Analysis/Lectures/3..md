### Theorem 1.1
Let ${} f, g:\Omega\to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ be continuous at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$. Then so are $\lambda f+\mu g$ for all ${} \lambda,\, \mu \in \mathbb{C} {}$, the product $fg {}$, and if ${} g(z_{0})\neq 0 {}$, then the quotient ${} f /g {}$. 

If ${} f:\Omega\to{}G \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$ is continuous at ${} z_{0} \in \Omega {}$, and ${} g:G \to{}\mathbb{C} {}$ is continuous at ${} f(z_{0})$, then ${} g \circ f {}$ is continuous at $z_{0}$. 

Let ${} u(z)=\mathrm{Re}(f(z)),\, v(z)=\mathrm{Im}(f(z)) {}$. So
$$
f(z)=u(z)+iv(z)=u(x,\, y)+iv(x,\, y)
$$
where ${} z=x+iy {}$. We know that ${} f(z_{n}) {}$ converge to ${} f(z_{0})$ iff ${} u(z_{n}) {}$ and ${} v(z_{n}) {}$ converge to ${} u(z_{0})$ and ${} v(z_{0})$ respectively.
