### Definition 1.1: Power Series
A power series is a series of the form
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n}
$$
where ${} z_{0} \in \mathbb{C} {}$ and ${} \{ a_{n} \}_{n=0}^{\infty} \subseteq \mathbb{C} {}$ are called the coefficients
### Theorem 1.2: 
For any power series ${} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n} {}$ there is a value ${} 0\leq \hat{R}\leq \infty  {}$ such that
- if ${} 0<\hat{R}<\infty  {}$, then the series converges absolutely for those $z$ with ${} |z-z_{0}|<\hat{R} {}$, that is, for all ${} z \in D(z_{0},\, \hat{R}) {}$ and diverges with ${} |z-z_{0}|>\hat{R} {}$
- If ${} \hat{R}=\infty  {}$, then the series converges absolutely for all ${} z \in \mathbb{C} {}$
- If ${} \hat{R}=0 {}$, then the series diverges for $z\neq z_{0}$.

In fact, we have that
$$
\hat{R}=\left( \limsup_{n\tto \infty}  |a_{n}|^{1/n} \right)^{-1}
$$
#### Proof:
Using the nth root test, set ${} w_{n}=a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n} {}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
L & =\limsup_{n\tto \infty} |w_{n}|^{1/n} \\
 & =\limsup_{n\tto \infty} |a_{n}(z-z_{0})|^{1/n} \\
 & =\limsup_{n\tto \infty} |a_{n}|^{1/n} |z-z_{0}| \\
 & =|z-z_{0}|\limsup_{n\tto \infty}|a_{n}|^{1/n} \\ 
 & =\frac{|z-z_{0} |}{\hat{R}} 
\end{align}
$$
and the rest follows trivially from the conditions of the rational root test
#### Remark:
Note that the radius of convergence does not say anything about points on the boundary of the disk
### Corollary 1.3:
Let ${} \hat{R} {}$ be the radius of convergence of ${} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n} {}$. Then this series converges uniformly in the closed disk ${} \conj{D(z_{0},\, r)} {}$ for any positive ${} r<\hat{R} {}$.
#### Proof:
#todo find this
### Theorem 1.4:
Assume that ${} a_{n}\neq 0 {}$. If the sequence ${} |a_{n}| / |a_{n+1}| {}$ converges, then ${} \hat{R}=\lim_{n\tto \infty} |a_{n}| / |a_{n+1}| {}$. 
#### Proof:
Let 
$$
C=\lim_{n\tto \infty} \frac{|a_{n}|}{|a_{n+1}|} 
$$
and set
$$
\begin{align}
 w_{ n} & =a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n}  \\
 L&  =\lim_{n\tto \infty} \frac{|w_{n+1}|}{|w_{n}|}  \\
 & =\lim_{n\tto \infty}  \frac{ |a_{n+1}||z-z_{0}|^{n+1}}{|a_{n}||z-z_{0}|^{n}}  \\
 & =|z-z_{0}| \lim_{n\tto \infty} \frac{|a_{n+1}|}{|a_{n}|} \\
 & =\frac{|z-z_{0}|}{C} 
 \end{align}
$$
As before, for absolute convergence, we need ${} L<1 {}$, that is, ${} |z-z_{0}|<C {}$, and for divergence we need $L>1 {}$, that is, ${} |z-z_{0}|>C {}$.
### Lemma 1.5:
For any ${} k \in \mathbb{N} {}$, the power series ${} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n+k}(z-z_{0})^{n} {}$ has the same radius of convergence as ${} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_{n}(z-z_{0})^{n} {}$. 
#### Proof:
